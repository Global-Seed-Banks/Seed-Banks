J	Ding, XQ; Wang, YF; Yu, SX				Ding, Xiaoqiu; Wang, Yongfan; Yu, Shixiao			NO EVIDENCE FOR A POSITIVE RESPONSE OF BIOMASS PRODUCTION TO SPECIES DIVERSITY IN AN EXPERIMENTAL GRASSLAND	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Plant diversity is generally thought to enhance productivity, driven by either (1) chance inclusion of highly productive species in more diverse communities or (2) niche-based resource acquisition with competitive interactions increasing resource use efficiency. Here, we ask whether weeding, as employed in most experiments to date, might contribute to the positive diversity-productivity relationship reported for many grasslands. Using all 82 species from our local pool, we constructed 357 experimental grassland plots (2 x 4 m each), arranged as a completely randomized experiment in an arable field prepared to minimize existing seed bank. The plots were sown to vary species richness (1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 or 40 species) and were maintained under both ambient conditions and experimental drought. A single monoculture plot was maintained for all 82 species, and each of the other eleven species richness levels was replicated 25 times. Plots were maintained strictly without weeding, and aboveground biomass was measured at 17, 19, 27 and 29 months after the start of this experiment. No single measure of biodiversity was significantly correlated with productivity consistently across all four sampling periods. Furthermore, there were only weak overall effects of six biodiversity variables (the species richness planted, observed, and sampled; Shannon diversity, effective species richness and evenness in the sampled area) on productivity under either precipitation treatment. Regression analysis identified no equation that used a consistent subset of the biodiversity measures as predictors. In view of these transient and insubstantial effects, results from previous experiments that employed weeding treatments are suspect as tests of the hypothesis that biodiversity has positive effects on productivity.

The behaviour of macaw palm (Acrocomia aculeata) seeds during storage	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												A hard endocarp and physiological dormancy make studies of the propagation and ex situ conservation of macaw palm seeds difficult and necessitate adaptations to existing protocols for classification of seed behaviour during storage. In vitro culture was used to evaluate the viability of embryos from seeds dehydrated to water content levels of 10 and 5% (fresh weight basis; seeds dried over silica gel at 20 degrees C and in a drying oven at 35 degrees C) and from seeds dried to 5% water content and stored for 90 days at -196, -20, 10 and 35 degrees C, and at room temperature (average 22 degrees C). Fruits were also kept in the open for one year under natural conditions, or were buried, left in the shade or stored in a cold-chamber (10 degrees C). Embryo viability and seed water content were determined before storage, after 15 days, and subsequently on a monthly basis over 12 months. The embryos maintained their viability when the seeds were subjected to dehydration by the two methods (silica and oven) and low temperatures (-196, -20, 10 degrees C). Storing the fruits at 10 degrees C maintained 85% embryo viability, has the advantage of not requiring prior processing and can thus be used for ex situ conservation. Burial and storage under shade conditions maintained 67% seed viability, while 34% of the seeds stored in the open remained viable. Macaw palm seeds are orthodox and can potentially form soil seed banks.

Comparing the establishment of an invasive and an endemic palm species in the Atlantic rainforest	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: Biological invasions are one of the major causes of biodiversity loss, yet remain rather understudied in tropical environments. The Australian palm tree Archontophoenix cunninghamiana was introduced into Brazil for ornamental purposes, but has become an invasive species in urban and suburban forest patches. The substitution of A. cunninghamiana by the native palm Euterpe edulis has been proposed as a management action. Aims: We aimed to evaluate the regeneration potential of these two palm species in an Atlantic forest remnant in south-eastern Brazil where both species occur. Methods: We compared seedling establishment and seed longevity of both species through seed sowing, and also measured the contribution of A. cunninghamiana to the local seed rain and seed bank. Results: Nearly half of the non-anemochoric diaspores collected from the seed rain belonged to A. cunninghamiana, which represented a high propagule pressure in the community. The distribution of the alien palm seeds in the seed rain correlated with the distribution of nearby young and adult individuals inside the forest. Neither A. cunninghamiana nor E. edulis appeared to have a persistent seed bank in a burial experiment; seedling survival experiments suggested a much better performance for A. cunninghamiana, which had a survival rate of ca. 30% compared with a rate of only 3.5% for E. edulis. Conclusions: The results suggest a higher regeneration capacity for the alien palm over the native species when co-occurring in a forest fragment. Management actions are thus proposed to reduce a potential biological invasion process.

Results showed that the potential germination species in three different Deyeuxia angutifolia community were 38 (which belong to 21 families, 34 genera), 28 (17 families, 24 genera) and 37 (19 families, 34 genera) respectively. There were significant differences existed in their compositional features between the soil seed bank and vegetation, and the range of their similarity indexes were less than 50 %. These differences may be contributed to the different water condition of Deyeuxia angutifolia communities in Sanjiang Plain. But it need further research to confirm our finding. Nevertheless, this study can serves as the theoretical basis for the biodiversity protection and the degraded wetland ecosystem restoration in Sanjiang Plain.																			978-1-4673-4497-5				2012																	WOS:000310335802195

K.; Greenslade, Penelope			Changes in vegetation over nine years after rehabilitating a linear feature in Australia's arid zone	RANGELAND JOURNAL												A 36-km road built in 1961 between Ayers Rock (Uluru) and the Olgas (Kata Tjuta), Northern Territory, Australia had seriously deteriorated by the 1980s. A newly aligned road, which was ecologically located and avoid sensitive Aboriginal sites, was completed early in 1991. The old road was rehabilitated by deep ripping, filling with imported sand and topsoil and by grading logs and windrows(1) over the new surface. This paper reports on the effectiveness of the rehabilitation technique used in reinstating vegetation over 8 years and considers whether this rehabilitation aim was met. Plant colonisation and succession were monitored on 15 paired plots, one in the rehabilitated road and the other in the adjacent undisturbed habitat (with four exceptions) and also on the windrows. Sites at eight creek crossings and those subject to fire and rabbit activity were also monitored. Different landscape units responded in different ways to the rehabilitation. Herbaceous species from imported sand plain fill and top soil eventually dominated the road where they were introduced and were likely to persist in most areas because of local recruitment. The revegetation of the road has stabilised the old road surface as observed by the reduced erosion although succession did not always approach the reference site communities because of a greater resemblance to the Simpson Land System. Over the 8 years of monitoring considerable changes in vegetation occurred and are probably continuing. Only the road sites in the Simpson Land System approached the condition of the adjacent undisturbed vegetation because the vegetation of the other two land systems became closer to that of the Simpson Land System rather than to that of the surrounding vegetation. It is recommended that the introduced Buffel grass, known to alter landscape-level processes by reducing native herbaceous species and increasing risk of high intensity wildfire, which is most evident at creek crossings, should be controlled. Recommendations are made for improved management.																	1036-9872						2012	34	4					399	414		10.1071/RJ12033							WOS:000312390200007

Persistence of bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypifolia L.) soil seed banks	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Bellyache bush (Jatropha gossypifolia L.) is an invasive shrub that adversely impacts agricultural and natural systems of northern Australia. While several techniques are available to control bellyache bush, depletion of soil seed banks is central to its management. A 10-year study determined the persistence of intact and ant-discarded bellyache bush seeds buried in shade cloth packets at six depths (ranging from 0 to 40 cm) under both natural rainfall and rainfall-excluded conditions. A second study monitored changes in seedling emergence over time, to provide an indication of the natural rate of seed bank depletion at two sites (rocky and heavy clay) following the physical removal of all bellyache bush plants. Persistence of seed in the burial trial varied depending on seed type, rainfall conditions and burial depth. No viable seeds of bellyache bush remained after 72 months irrespective of seed type under natural rainfall conditions. When rainfall was excluded seeds persisted for much longer, with a small portion (0.4%) of ant-discarded seeds still viable after 120 months. Seed persistence was prolonged (> 96 months to decline to < 1% viability) at all burial depths under rainfall-excluded conditions. In contrast, under natural rainfall, surface located seeds took twice as long (70 months) to decline to 1% viability compared with buried seeds (35 months). No seedling emergence was observed after 58 months and 36 months at the rocky and heavy clay soil sites, respectively. These results suggest that the required duration of control programs on bellyache bush may vary due to the effect of biotic and abiotic factors on persistence of soil seed banks.

Plant traits and spread of the invasive salt marsh grass, Spartina alterniflora Loisel., in the Great Brak Estuary, South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE												Spartina alterniflora Loisel., widely recognised as an aggressive invader of estuaries and salt marshes around the world, was discovered growing in the temporarily open/closed Great Brak Estuary on the southern Cape coast of South Africa in 2004. This is the first record of this invasive plant in Africa as well as its first occurrence in an estuary that closes to the sea. Plant traits and sediment characteristics were measured in 2009 and 2011 and found to be comparable to those reported elsewhere. Prior to the 2011 sampling, S. alterniflora stands had been flooded for almost eight months. As a result, sediment redox potential (-268 + 4 mV) was significantly lower in 2011. Sediments were mostly clay in 2009 (71 +/- 0.01%) compared to a predominance of sand in 2011 (40 +/- 0.02%). These differences were related to the artificial breaching of the estuary one month prior to sampling in March 2011. The grass currently occupies 1.1 ha in the salt marsh, sandflat and mudflat habitats of the estuary where its cover is expanding at a rate of 0.162 ha y(-1). Individual stands numbered about 12 in 2006, but have increased to 24 in 2011. These stands are expanding laterally at 0.9 m y(-1) although the long period of inundation during 2010 reduced this to 0.6 m y(-1). Expansion is due to vegetative spread as an analysis of the sediment seed bank showed no S. alterniflora seeds and very few salt marsh seeds (1 132 seeds m(-2)). If left unchecked, S. alterniflora has the potential to replace 42.9 ha or 41% of the total estuary habitat in the Great Brak Estuary, but also has the potential to invade other estuaries in South Africa, especially those with extensive intertidal habitat and containing S. maritima (19 estuaries in total). This study illustrates the adaptive potential of this invasive marsh plant and indicates the possibility of invasion in seasonally closed estuaries in other locations around the world.

J	Leon-Lobos, P; Way, M; Aranda, PD; Lima, M				Leon-Lobos, Pedro; Way, Michael; Aranda, Patricia D.; Lima-Junior, Manuel			The role of ex situ seed banks in the conservation of plant diversity and in ecological restoration in Latin America	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: Over half of the world's primary forest and a quarter of the world's plant species are found in Latin America. As a result of the limited protected areas and significant degradation of terrestrial ecosystems, seed banks provide an efficient component of integrated plant conservation strategies, chiefly due to their relatively low cost and massive storage capacity for genetic resources. Aims: We analyse the role that ex situ seed banks play in the conservation and reintroduction of threatened species, and in supporting ecological restoration programmes in the region. Methods: An analysis of the second National Reports on the state of the World's Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture showed that most countries in the region had the capacity for seed conservation. Using three case studies from seed conservation programmes in Mexico, Brazilian Amazonia and Chile, together with the global Millennium Seed Bank Partnership, we review the status and potential of these initiatives for conservation of plant diversity. Conclusion: The collection, conservation and use of seeds from arid and semi-arid biomes is highly effective; however the higher frequency of recalcitrant seeds in humid tropical forests requires a greater investment in research to underpin large-scale seed banking. In order to safeguard native species and provide adequate diversity of seeds for habitat restoration programmes, we anticipate the need to strengthen the capacity of the region's seed banks for preservation, research and propagation of native species.																	1755-0874	1755-1668					2012	5	2			SI		245	258		10.1080/17550874.2012.713402							WOS:000311559700011

From seed to seedling: A critical transitional stage for the Mediterranean psammophilous species Dianthus morisianus (Caryophyllaceae)	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Seed germination, seedling emergence and seed persistence in the soil were investigated for Dianthus morisianus (Caryophyllaceae), a psammophilous endemic species of Sardinia. Stored and freshly collected seeds were incubated in a range of constant temperatures (5-25 degrees C) and an alternating temperature regime (25/10 degrees C). The effect of seed burial depth on seedling emergence was investigated under controlled environmental conditions. Seed persistence in the soil was verified by in situ experimental seed burials. Seeds of this species were non-dormant, and all seed lots germinated both in the light and darkness, mainly at low temperatures (<= 20 degrees C), with a maximum at 15 degrees C (>= 95%). Optimal seedling emergence was obtained when seeds were buried at a depth of 1-2 cm, and a declining emergence with increasing depth was observed. D. morisianus was also unable to form a persistent soil seed bank. The fate of the seeds that, after dispersal, do not emerge from the soil in the spring is, therefore, presumably to die before the next favourable growing season.

J	Garcia-Camacho, R; Albert, MJ; Escudero, A				Garcia-Camacho, Raul; Albert, Maria J.; Escudero, Adrian			Small-scale demographic compensation in a high-mountain endemic: the low edge stands still	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: Under the current warming process, with its implications of higher temperatures, less rainfall, snowfall and snow cover, low-edge populations of high-mountain plants are expected to decline. Demographic studies are useful to foresee the future dynamics of species ranges. Adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, and demographic compensation have been proposed as mechanisms to cope with climate change. Aim: We studied the population dynamics of the high-mountain narrow endemic Armeria caespitosa at the extremes of its altitude distribution (low versus high edge), the high edge representing colonised summits that provide optimal growing conditions. The focus of the study was to establish if the species is retracting at its lower distribution range. Methods: We used 4 years of population censuses and soil seed bank data. Population matrix models allowed us to study the stochastic population growth rates, the species long-term viability under higher frequency of extreme years, and the life cycle transitions responsible for the differences in population dynamics between elevation range edges. Results: The low edge of the A. caespitosa elevation range appeared stable, with positive population growth rates under current environmental conditions, and a null quasi-extinction probability in the long-term under scenarios of high frequency of extremely dry years. Conclusions: The species will likely withstand the current climate-warming scenario along its elevation range. Results supported the role of so-called demographic compensation at a small spatial scale, which we argue might be common in the Mediterranean mountains.

Vegetation change in response to grazing exclusion in montane grasslands, Argentina	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Background and aims - Natural montane grasslands in the Southern Pampas of Argentina are expected to show a high potential for recovery after heavy grazing due to their evolutionary history in the presence of large herbivores and their high productivity. The objective of this work is to compare plant diversity, bare soil percentage, biomass and botanical composition between grazed and non-grazed areas at different times following grazing exclusion. Methods - Vegetation was assessed on exclosures established in 2006 and on nearby areas open to grazing by feral horses in December 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In 2009 we added 15 year old exclosures to the analysis. Key results - Species richness declined 24 months after grazing exclusion, mainly due to a decrease in the abundance of forb species. Bare soil percentage was significantly reduced 12 months after exclosures were built. Above-ground biomass showed a 3-fold increase 12 months after grazing exclusion. After three years, species richness and biomass were similar to those corresponding to older exclosures (15-years old). The composition of plant communities also changed following horse exclusion, with three and 15-years old exclosures dominated by perennial grasses typical of late seral stages. Conclusions - Our results support the hypothesis that natural montane grasslands in the Southern Pampas of Argentina may recover fast from grazing by large herbivores without application of specific restoration techniques.

The seed ecology of two invasive Hieracium (Asteraceae) species	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Two highly invasive hawkweeds, Hieracium aurantiacum and H. praealtum L., have established in the Australian Alps. Our experiments aimed to provide a better understanding of the seed ecology of these species, essential if successful eradication strategies are to be developed. Results indicated that viable seeds are produced in large numbers. Seeds germinate spontaneously and synchronously with light and moisture and are killed when exposed to temperatures above 110 degrees C for 150 s. No seedlings of H. aurantiacum emerged from soil samples taken from a chronosequence of known infestations, but some H. praealtum seedlings emerged from soil sampled from sites where plants flowered the preceding summer. Germination was greatly reduced for both species under darkness, and few seedlings emerged when buried. Where herbicides were applied at a late stage of fruit development, hawkweeds continued to produce viable seeds, albeit in reduced numbers. Overall, our findings indicate that both species produce a large amount of seed, little of which enters the long-term soil seed bank. This, and the limited ability of buried seeds to germinate and/or emerge, means that Hieracium control programs should emphasise short-term (1-2-year) monitoring of treated sites and stress the importance of reducing the seed set.

J	Sanaa, AIM				Sanaa, A. I. Moussa			Perspectives on the relationship between invisibility, richness, plant size, seed production, seed bank and community productivity of invasive Argemone ochroleuca Sweet in Taif, Saudi Arabia	LIFE SCIENCE JOURNAL-ACTA ZHENGZHOU UNIVERSITY OVERSEAS EDITION												Argemone ochroleuca Sweet is an invasive desert weed species; a worldwide medicinal plant with economic potentialities. It is recently introduced, in Saudi Arabia especially in Taif Governorate. The later is one of the largest areas, in the Southeastern of K. S. A. characteristic by its high diversity in local climatic and topographic conditions. Dryness is a characteristic climatic feature of the area since rainfall is less than 10 inches and a maximum temperature of 37(0)C are reached in September. Temperature decreases the dryness in the angle of rain and evaporation, thus it affects the vegetation of the area. The large widespread of the species due to its high propagation ability encourages the studying of the inter-relationship between its invisibility and some of the biological characteristic features such as species richness of its communities, average plant size, seed production ability and Argemone stored seeds (number of seeds contained. m(-2) of surface soil). Some of the chemical characters of the soil such as the organic matter content as well as the variations in topographic features of the different habitats could be main reasons for the variations in species productivity in the different habitats. Nine localities representing three different habitats; sand plains, dams& wadies were selected. Argemone ochroleuca is highly reproducible invasive desert weed; it produces a huge average number of 189 capsules, with a maximal number (258) at Al-Shafa and a minimal (162) at Jabajeb. An average number of 453 seeds per capsule-with a higher value (473) at Al-Shafa-was counted. An overall average number of 85, 850 seeds per individual were obtained. The immense number of seeds evinces the high propagation of the species. A. ochroleuca tends to inhabit the less fertile soil and reduces the native plant diversity in Taif. A. seeds stored in superficial soil (seed bank; SB) attained an average value of 7, 736. m(-2); the highest (13,600) at Jabajeb. Species richness; SR, was negatively correlated with invisibility (INV). The later was positively correlated with both plant size (PS) and seed production (SP), while negatively correlated with SR & SB. PS was positively correlated with INV and SR. A negative correlation was also between SR and all other variables. PS was negatively correlated with either SR or SB. [Sanaa, A. I. Moussa.

Activity on Soil Property and Seed Bank after Revegetation in the Tengger Desert	ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT												In Shapotou, northeast of the Tengger Desert in China, Formica cunicularia Lat. proliferated after mobile sand dune stabilization by artificial revegetation. In the present paper, the anthill properties of F. cunicularia after sand stabilization were systematically investigated along a chronosequence. The soil properties and soil seed banks in the anthill and adjacent soils without anthills were also examined. The results showed that the revegetation age, landform, and their interactions significantly affected the anthill density, anthill coverage, and soil turnover capacity of F. cunicularia. The longer the dunes were stabilized, the more ant nests proliferated in the dunes. More nests were located in the hollow and windward slopes than in the dune top and leeward slopes. Soil organic matter, total and available N, P, and K, electrical conductivity, as well as soil water content were all significantly higher in the nests than in the adjacent soils without anthills. The soil seed bank in the anthill was much greater than in the adjacent soil for both moss-and algal-crusted soils. The current research suggested that the occurrence of F. cunicularia after mobile sand dune stabilization greatly influenced both soil properties and soil seed bank.																	1532-4982	1532-4990					2012	26	4					365	378		10.1080/15324982.2012.694393							WOS:000308994400008						
B	Wilkinson, J		Ornek, F; Saleh, IM		Wilkinson, John			TEACHING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE An Action Research Approach	CONTEMPORARY SCIENCE TEACHING APPROACHES: PROMOTING CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING IN SCIENCE												Climate change is a pressing global issue of considerable interest to professional scientists as well as policymakers and even average citizens. It spans multiple scientific disciplines, and much of the professional sciences requires sophisticated and expensive computer models. At the same time, there is a growing awareness of the need for laboratory experiences in the science classroom that teach both content and science as a method of inquiry. Further complicating matters are the cost of laboratory equipment and the inherent variability of climate change impact. However, it is generally accepted that sea levels will rise due to thermal expansion and glacier melting, so any student living in a coastal area could potentially research climate change. This chapter reviews the scientific basis of climate change and its potential impact on society at large. It then proposes a combination of field and laboratory experience for students who will assess the potential impact of climate change in their region through the lens of botany. Students or a teacher will collect a seed bank from the nearest estuary or freshwater marsh. They will then treat the seeds with varying concentrations of saltwater and record the differences in germinations observed. Based on these findings, they will then predict the impact that increased salinity will have on their local biota.																			978-1-61735-608-7				2012							55	71									WOS:000305161900005

Regional responsibility for plant conservation: The 2010 GSPC Target 8 in Sardinia	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The collections stored at the Sardinian Germplasm Bank (BG-SAR) were analysed to verify if setting conservation priorities on the exclusive endemic flora of Sardinia (Italy) would make it possible to reach the 2010 GSPC Target 8. By 2010, 39.9% of the exclusive-endemics of Sardinia, 43.1% of the BGCI European threatened species and 65.0% of the taxa listed in Annex II of DIR 92/43/EEC present on the island had been stored in BG-SAR. Of the stored plants, 40% of those listed in the DIR 92/43/EEC, and only 25.69% of the BGCI threatened plants are represented by an adequate number of populations. For a few of the stored threatened plants (ca. 36%), and for 60% of the DIR 92/43/EEC ones, at least one seedlot with more than 5000 seeds is available. These data indicate that focusing on exclusive endemics gave a substantial, although not decisive, contribution towards the achievement of the 2010 GSPC Target 8 in Sardinia, and that more efforts are needed to guarantee the effective long-term conservation of these threatened taxa with the aim of reaching the 2020 GSPC target.

Ten years primary succession on a newly created landfill at a lagoon of the Mediterranean Sea (Lake Burullus RAMSAR site)	FLORA												This study was carried out on the transported bed soil dredged from the outlet of Lake Burullus to the Mediterranean Sea and deposited nearby, forming by this way new land that underwent a primary plant succession. The multi-methodological approach comprised floristic inventories, vegetation sampling and soil composition analyses of the study site in order to detect the crucial parameters controlling the plant resettlement on recently deposited soil as related to time, local micro-topography and substrate characteristics. Floristic composition was assessed for the first 10 years of primary succession (2001-2010) on 18 stands of the area, distributed on basement, slope stands and plateau of the landfill, respectively. Vegetation surveys were the basis of multivariate analyses of the vegetation and soil data using TWINSPAN, DCA and CCA. Relationships between the edaphic gradients, floristic composition and species diversity were assessed. Forty-one species were identified (22 annuals and 19 perennials) after ten years development compared with 7 species at the first year. After application of TWINSPAN and DCA on the data of the first year of establishment, two simple vegetation groups were recognized and named after their dominant species, Senecio glaucus and Bassia indica. In comparison, the multivariate analysis of the last year (i.e. after 10 years of succession) led to identify 4 more advanced vegetation groups: Senecio glaucus-Cakile maritima-Zygophyllum album, Bassia indica-Mesembryanthemum nodiflorum, Arthrocnemum macrostachyum and Phragmites australis-Limbarda crithmoides. These plant communities are comparable to the other communities in the same region, showing the tendency to establish the climax vegetation of Mediterranean coastal areas. The notable edaphic variables that affect the succession of the vegetation groups in the study area were moisture, salinity, organic matter, minerals (Ca, Na, K, Cl, SO4), soil texture and human disturbance.

Deer Impacts on Seed Banks and Saplings in Eastern New York	NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												Selective browsing by Odocoileus virginianus (White-tailed Deer) has shifted plant communities in the Northeast, but the effects of seed dispersal by deer on forest seed banks are unknown. We used data from deer exclosures in hunted and unhunted properties in southeastern New York to determine whether deer browsing and different deer management histories have altered composition and/or abundance of forest saplings and seed banks. Results indicate that deer did not alter species richness, abundance, or composition in seed banks in either hunted or unhunted areas. Deer did, however, decrease sapling density and richness at the unhunted site but not at the hunted site. We conclude that impacts of unmanaged deer populations are greater on sapling recruitment than on seed banks.

Germination strategies of annual forbs from south-eastern Australian semiarid grasslands	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Germination is a key process driving the composition and dynamics of annual-forb communities and soil seed banks. We tested the germination biology of 20 annual forbs from semiarid grasslands in southern Australia, under a single temperature regime (20/10 degrees C) in either constant darkness or 12-h diurnal light, to assess whether their laboratory germination responses are consistent with transient seed banks and rapid field emergence. Germination in the light was generally moderate to high, with most (70%) species achieving >35% final germination. Additionally, most (90%) species began germinating within 5 days, and all species achieved at least 50% of final germination within 10 days, suggesting that rapid and synchronous germination is the main strategy of annual forbs in this region. However, several species had seeds that continued to germinate for a prolonged period, and in most species, a fraction of seeds did not germinate, demonstrating risk-spreading strategies. Additionally, the germination of most (79%) species was significantly inhibited by continuous darkness. Despite the potential for the formation of large persistent seed banks through low germination in some species and dark inhibition in most, rapid germination and prevailing environmental conditions apparently prevent this in the field.																	0067-1924						2012	60	4					340	346		10.1071/BT12027							WOS:000305623900006						
J	Rodrigo, A; Arnan, X; Retana, J				Rodrigo, Anselm; Arnan, Xavier; Retana, Javier			Relevance of soil seed bank and seed rain to immediate seed supply after a large wildfire	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												We examined the density and composition of the immediate seed supply (i.e. instant potential post-fire germination from soil seed bank and off-site seed rain) after a large wildfire in a sub-Mediterranean pine forest. We also tested the effects of fire severity and distance from unburned edges on the density and composition of the seed bank and the immediate off-site seed rain. Our results showed that although seed density did not differ between them, their composition was markedly different. The soil seed bank was dominated by species from the Fabaceae family with limited dispersal mechanisms such as autochory and barochory, whereas the seed rain was mainly composed of species from the Asteraceae family with wind-dispersed seeds. These patterns were not affected either by fire severity or distance from the fire edge. The main conclusion of the study is that both the soil seed bank and the seed rain play an important role in providing seeds for immediate regeneration after a large wildfire throughout the burned area. We suggest that the role of seed rain on immediate post-fire recovery of Mediterranean plant communities might be more important than has previously been thought. However, the effective role of this group of species on the longer term should be evaluated.

Adaptation to habitat in Aquilegia species endemic to Sardinia (Italy): Seed dispersal, germination and persistence in the soil	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												The autecology of the Sardinian endemics Aquilegia barbaricina Arrigoni et Nardi and A. nugorensis Arrigoni et Nardi were investigated. Peaks of anthesis and seed dispersal were recorded for five populations occurring in two distinct habitats, one riparian and one rupicolous. Germination tests were carried out on seed lots belonging to each population by sowing seeds at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 25/15 degrees C. In addition, seeds were incubated for 2 months at either 25 degrees C (summer), 5 degrees C (winter) or 25 degrees C for 2 months plus 2 months at 5 degrees C (summer followed by winter-SW), and then moved to the germination temperatures. Embryo measurements were taken during pre-treatments and germination. Experimental seed burials were carried out for two populations of each species. Both species dispersed in summer. The population of A. nugorensis occurring on rocky outcrops differed in phenology from both the other A. nugorensis population from riparian vegetation and from A. barbaricina. Both species showed morphophysiological seed dormancy, with<50% germination under laboratory conditions. All riparian populations germinated only after the SW pre-treatment, while the rupicolous population germinated at 25 degrees C, without any pre-treatment. Low germination percentages were observed in the experimental seed burials, suggesting the ability for both species to form a persistent soil seed bank.

J	Agra, H; Ne'eman, G				Agra, Har'el; Ne'eman, Gidi			Composition and diversity of herbaceous patches in woody vegetation: The effects of grazing, soil seed bank, patch spatial properties and scale	FLORA												Herbaceous plants contribute much to plant diversity in Mediterranean-type ecosystems though mostly occupying relatively small patches within the dense woody vegetation. While studying species diversity in the herbaceous patches, we hypothesized that grazing, soil seed bank, and spatial properties of the patch affect plant diversity and composition at different spatial scales. The study site was in an LTER site located in the Mediterranean region in north Israel. We determined herbaceous species composition in: (1) randomly sampled quadrats in herbaceous patches in grazed and un-grazed plots: (2) soil seed bank samples taken from the same patches and germinated under optimal greenhouse conditions: (3) quadrats in the same patches sown with a homogenous mixture of local soil samples. Using GIS methods, we determined small-scale spatial characteristics of the herbaceous patches. Alpha and beta diversities were calculated at the patch and plot scales using Shannon's entropy H. Grazing increased alpha diversity of local untreated seed bank samples but decreased alpha diversity of the artificial homogenous soil seed bank mixture at both patch and plot scales. Positive relation between alpha diversity and patch area was detected only under grazing. Grazing increased beta diversity in all three treatments at the patch scale. Grazing decreased the similarity in species composition between above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank. The results indicate that moderate cattle-grazing affects species diversity in the herbaceous patches within the dense maquis. This effect is scale-dependent, and interacts with the effects of soil seed bank and patch spatial-properties: without grazing soil seed bank plays a more important role than patch spatial properties, but under grazing the size and the accessibility of the patch are more important in the determination of herbaceous species composition.

Seed-bank and seedling dynamics in Hyparrhenia hirta are influenced by herbicide application and mowing management	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Hyparrhenia hirta (L.) Stapf (Coolatai grass) is a summer-active, C-4 perennial tussock grass, native to southern Africa and the Mediterranean region, which has invaded areas of native flora in Australia in recent decades. Understanding its seed and seedling dynamics and how various management treatments (e. g. mowing, herbicide and no management) affect these may assist in identifying the conditions and management strategies required to limit its invasion. The population dynamics of H. hirta have not been comprehensively studied previously. A 2-year field experiment (December 2005-December 2007) was conducted to determine the seed-bank size, pattern of seedling emergence and survival of H. hirta seedlings at three sites in northern New South Wales, Australia, under three treatments: unmanaged (control), mowing and herbicide treatments. The density of H. hirta seeds in the soil at each experimental site under different treatments was measured in December 2005 at the start of the experiment, in December 2006 before the application of the second round of treatments and again at the end of the experiment in December 2007. Hyparrhenia hirta seedlings were assessed at monthly intervals in permanent quadrats (0.5 x 0.5 m) to determine seedling emergence and survival. Seedling emergence occurred on many occasions during the 2-year period of the experiment in each treatment and at all sites but the main seedling flushes were observed from mid summer to early autumn. In 2007, at all sites, seedling emergence declined by more than 90% on the mowing and herbicide treatments compared with the control treatment. Seedling survival was greater in the mowing and herbicide treatments than in the control treatment. The seedling cohorts emerging in winter had a lower survival. This study showed that H. hirta infestations have a large viable seed-bank (similar to 3000 m(-2)), dependent on the level of infestation and climatic conditions, but that the seed-bank declines rapidly when seed addition is prevented. Some form of direct control of established H. hirta plants in combination with providing appropriate grazing management to encourage competition between grasses will assist in the control of H. hirta.

Laboratory germination and seed bank storage of Ranunculus peltatus subsp baudotii seeds from the Tuscan Archipelago	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Germination requirements and suitability for ex situ conservation were investigated for seeds from the only population of Ranunculus peltatus Schrank subsp. baudotii (Godron) Meikle ex C.D.K. Cook (Ranunculaceae) from the Tuscan Archipelago (Italy). A 2 x 2 x 3 factorial experiment investigated the interactive effects of light, alternating temperatures and mean temperature on the germination of seeds sown on agar. Logistic regression analysis showed significant effects of both temperature (P < 0.0001) and light (P < 0.05). Alternating temperatures improved germination but only at mean temperatures of 20 and 15 degrees C. The results indicate that seeds of R. baudotii exhibit morphological dormancy and a phenological adaptation to seasonal ponds. Drying led to a significant reduction in germination in seeds collected in both 2009 and 2010 (P < 0.05); the reduction was larger for 2009. The better quality of the 2010 seed was probably due to a post-harvest treatment that enabled continued maturation of the seeds. Storage of seeds for one year under seed bank conditions (-20 degrees C) did not reduce viability. Seeds of R. baudotii possess orthodox storage behaviour and are therefore suited to ex situ conservation in seed banks; however, further research is needed to confirm their long term storage prospects.

The plant re-colonization from the existing soil seed bank and changes in the physico-chemical properties of the soil were evaluated in field plots amended with lime and/or compost. We found that the application of lime and/or compost decreased the Cu2+ ion activity in the soil solution and the exchangeable Cu in the soil, showing an effective Cu immobilization in the topsoil. Whereas lime application had no effect on plant productivity in comparison with the unamended control, the application of compost and lime+compost increased the plant cover and aboveground biomass due to the higher nutrient availability and water-holding capacity of the compost-amended soils. Although the Cu2+ activity and the exchangeable Cu were markedly lower in the amended soils than in the unamended control, the shoot Cu concentrations of Lolium spp. and Eschscholzia californica did not differ between the treatments.				; Ginocchio, Rosanna/C-9637-2016	Mench, michel/0000-0002-0273-4142; Ginocchio, Rosanna/0000-0003-4089-8188												1522-6514	1549-7879					2012	14	8					820	833		10.1080/15226514.2011.628716							WOS:000304211000008	22908647

Our goal was to investigate its seed biology (production, dispersal, seed bank longevity, afterripening, seed longevity after storage using germination and emergence, and seedling establishment). This information will be useful for conservation efforts of this endangered species. Over a ten-year period, various seed biology parameters were measured. Infructescences were counted to estimate seed production with 110-744 seeds per reproductive plant. Soil samples were collected at various distances to estimate dispersal where seeds dispersed less than a meter, and also at various times to estimate longevity in the seed bank where only 4% as many seeds were found in November as in June. After-ripening tests used seeds imbibed every two months after harvest for ten months where germination rates increased when imbibition was delayed at least six months. Germination and emergence of stored seed was measured to estimate longevity. Seeds stored at 4 degrees C and 40-50% relative humidity remained viable for at least six years. For establishment and plant density, seedlings, vegetative plants, and reproductive plants were counted. For establishment, densities were 0-11 seedlings m(-2). This seed biology information could be applied to conservation efforts for this endangered species.																	1095-5674					JAN-MAR	2012	139	1					63	75		10.3159/TORREY-D-11-00050.1							WOS:000303902900007

Seed germination ecology of three imperiled plants of rock outcrops in the southeastern United States	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												ALBRECHT, M. A. AND J. C. PENAGOS Z.

Seed germination ecology of three imperiled plants of rock outcrops in the southeastern United States. J. Torrey Bot. Soc. 139: 86-95.-2012. The success of rare plant conservation programs depends upon understanding the ecological factors that regulate seed dormancy and germination. In this study, we characterize the germination niche with respect to temperature and light of three imperiled perennials that are endemic to rock outcrops in the southeastern United States: Astragaltes bibullatus, Claytonia ozarkensis, and Conradina verticillata. Our results show that a majority of seeds for each species are unable to germinate at habitat temperatures prevailing after dispersal in early summer. Seeds of the rockface endemic Claytonia ozarkensis germinated to high rates in darkness at 5 C, suggesting germination is confined to winter and that seeds are unable to persist beyond one germination season (transient seed bank). For Conradina verticillata, 44% of seeds germinated without cold stratification, while the remainder required cold stratification and light to overcome physiological dormancy. Following cold stratification, Conradina verticillata seeds germinated in light at cool (15/5 degrees C) but not at warm (30/15 degrees C) temperatures, although overall seed viability was low (26%). Seeds of Astragahts bibullatus germinated to low rates (< 10%) in seasonal temperature sequences, confirming that this species forms a persistent seed bank. Seeds of Astragalus bibullatus lost viability following heat shock for 30 min at 125 degrees C, but germinated to > 50% following mechanical scarification and incubation at 30/15 degrees C. Results from this study can be used to maximize germination for ex situ and reintroduction programs, and provide insight into managing wild populations.																	1095-5674					JAN-MAR	2012	139	1					86	95		10.3159/TORREY-D-11-00066.1							WOS:000303902900009

Vegetation and soil seed bank relationships across microhabitats in an abandoned Quercus suber parkland under simulated fire	ECOSCIENCE												Mediterranean agro-forestry systems are undergoing rapid change due to abandonment. This turns formerly cultivated or grazed oak-tree parklands (i.e., savanna-type formations called "dehesas") into flammable formations of scattered trees within a matrix of shrubs with open spaces. Wildfires can now occur, threatening the persistence of these formations. Fire-prone shrublands commonly regenerate after fire from seeds stored in the soil. Understanding the relationships between standing vegetation and the soil seed bank across microhabitats can help predict the response of the system in case of fire. Here we investigated these relationships in an abandoned Quercus suber (cork oak) dehesa in central Spain. Vegetation and soil were sampled and assigned to different microhabitats: under the trees (TRC), in dense shrub cover (DSC), and in low shrub cover (LSC). A heat shock was applied to half of each sample to simulate fire; the other half served as control. Both sets of samples were then germinated in a greenhouse. Almost 90% of the species were herbs, while the rest were woody shrubs. The number of species recorded in TRC and DSC was lower than in LSC, in which species richness, particularly herbs, was maximal. Heating increased the total number of species that germinated, but mean species richness per sample was not altered. Heating markedly increased the number of germinations in all microhabitats, particularly those of woody species. Furthermore, the germination of shrubby species increased in the 3 microhabitats, notably in TRC. While the standing plant community was well differentiated among microhabitats, this was not the case for the soil seed bank, which was homogeneous across microhabitats, with or without heating. We conclude that the high density of shrubby seeds found in TRC or in the other microhabitats presents substantial threats to the persistence of Q. suber parklands in case of fire.

J	Gijbels, P; Adriaens, D; Honnay, O				Gijbels, Pieter; Adriaens, Dries; Honnay, Olivier			An orchid colonization credit in restored calcareous grasslands	ECOSCIENCE												Habitat restoration comprises the re-creation of suitable environmental conditions with the intention of recolonization by certain target species. In previously abandoned calcareous grasslands, however, many characteristic plant species have been reported missing even decades after the reinstatement of traditional mowing or grazing management. Such grasslands are said to exhibit a colonization credit. This may be particularly true for orchid species, which often rely on highly specialized pollination strategies and mycorrhizal associations for completion of their life-cycle. In this study, we investigated whether restored calcareous grasslands exhibited an orchid colonization credit, whether this credit was associated with the degree of grassland fragmentation, and with particular species' life history traits. Applying the Beals index as a quantitative method to identify suitable habitats, several orchid species were indeed found missing from grasslands deemed suitable. There was no relation, however, between the extent of the colonization credit and the spatial isolation or size of the grasslands. Of all life history traits examined, only a high degree of pollinator specialization could be related to delayed colonization. This may suggest that restoring the pollinator community is an important bottleneck in calcareous grassland restoration.

Uromycladium tepperianum (a gall-forming rust fungus) causes a sustained epidemic on the weed Acacia saligna in South Africa	AUSTRALASIAN PLANT PATHOLOGY												Uromycladium tepperianum, a gall inducing rust fungus native to Australasia, was introduced into South Africa as a biological control agent in 1987. Incidence and severity of infection has been monitored from 1991 to 2010 at permanent sites. After release, disease incidence increased rapidly and it has stayed at (or just under) 100% on plants >= 5 cm stem diameter since. Incidence on smaller plants has decreased then increased rapidly following years of fires with mass regeneration from the soil-stored seed bank, or following years of high recruitment in the absence of fire. The maximum severity on mature trees is approximately 2000 galls per tree, with severity increasing exponentially with increasing tree size.

A threatened alpine species, Fritillaria tubiformis subsp moggridgei: Seed morphology and temperature regulation of embryo growth	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Alpine plants have evolved to fit their life cycle into the short vegetative season of mountain habitats. Fritillaria tubiformis Gren. & Godr. subsp. moggridgei (Boiss. & Reuter ex Planch.) Rix (Liliaceae) is an endemic alpine geophyte, bearing seeds with underdeveloped embryos. Seeds are dispersed in August and embryos complete their development by spring when seeds germinate. In order to optimize seed banking procedures and to develop a proper germination protocol for plant regeneration, we studied embryo morphogenesis and analyzed how this process is influenced by temperature. Radicle protrusion occurred after an incubation of 5 months at 4 degrees C. Under these conditions, underdeveloped embryos reached maturity and acquired a well-defined shoot apex. At the time of dispersal, abundant storage compounds were present in seeds. Lipids and lipid/proteins were uniformly distributed within the embryo and the endosperm, respectively. At late stages of embryo development, starch granules were localized at the cotyledonary tip and were also detected around the shoot meristem. Results suggested that F. tubiformis embryos resumed growth over a large range of temperatures, but were only able to complete development at low temperatures after which they were able to germinate by spring.

J	Jimenez, JF; Sanchez-Gomez, P				Francisco Jimenez, Juan; Sanchez-Gomez, Pedro			Molecular taxonomy and genetic diversity of Moricandia moricandioides subsp pseudofoetida compared to wild relatives	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Moricandia moricandioides subsp. pseudofoetida is a taxon endemic to the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, of which only one population is known. In this study, we used Inter Simple Sequence Repeat molecular markers to compare the taxon's genetic diversity with that of populations with similar ecological characteristics belonging to Iberian endemic species of the genus Moricandia (M. moricandioides subsp. moricandioides and Moricandia foetida) and to the widely distributed Moricandia arvensis, in the context of the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula. The results indicated that M. moricandioides subsp. pseudofoetida has genetic diversity values similar to the two other endemic taxa, while M. arvensis has higher diversity values. We established a hypothesis concerning the origin of M. moricandioides subsp. pseudofoetida, since our results suggested that this taxon arose by reproductive isolation rather than hybridization between M. foetida and M. moricandioides. Our results might serve as a starting point to obtain a clear phylogenetic pattern for the genus. Finally, we proposed measures for the conservation of this rare taxon and recommendations for the collection of siliques to establish a seed bank.

J	Jaunatre, R; Buisson, E; Dutoit, T				Jaunatre, Renaud; Buisson, Elise; Dutoit, Thierry			First-year results of a multi-treatment steppe restoration experiment in La Crau (Provence, France)	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Background and aims - Intense agriculture phases on old plant communities, such as Mediterranean steppes, can lead to low resilience. Two main obstacles to the spontaneous recolonization of these plant communities are often the low dispersal of target species and the high dispersal and establishment potential of unwanted species. The aim of the study is to find the most efficient restoration treatments to restore these plant communities. Methods - After the rehabilitation of an herbaceous sheep-grazed community on a formerly intensively cultivated orchard in the last French Mediterranean steppe (La Crau, Provence, France), four experimental restoration treatments were applied to restore the steppe plant community: (i) topsoil removal to lower ruderal species seed banks and soil trophic levels, (ii) nurse species seeding to rapidly occupy niches, and then to provide safe sites for target species once sheep grazing is reintroduced, (iii) hay transfer to provide local species seeds, and (iv) soil transfer to provide local species propagules with associated microorganisms. One year later, plant species richness, composition and diversity are compared. Results - Although the communities developing on areas seeded with nurse species and where topsoil was removed differed most widely from the reference ecosystem, i.e. steppe, these restoration treatments succeeded in achieving their goal by significantly lowering the abundance of unwanted dominant species. While hay transfer did not have a significantly higher species richness than that of the rehabilitated area, it showed promising results, as some germinations of target species were observed. One year only after the treatment was applied, soil transfer provided a community richness and composition very close to that of the reference ecosystem, but not with the same vegetation structure. Conclusion - In order to restore plant community composition, the more the treatment strengthens community dispersal, the more efficient it is. The gain in efficiency is closely linked with the cost of the treatment.

This paper is the first approximation of the abundance of pollinator species associated with Eucalyptus nitens in a Clonal seed-bank plantation (CSBP) of the farm "Rucamanqui", Huepil, Biobio Region in Chile. Between October and November 2010, we examined the variation of pollinator's entomofauna of E. nitens. Environmental factors, such as temperature and the number of open flowers per plant, were registered to determine the level of dependence on the frequency of visits. The most abundant insects visiting E. nitens belonged to the orders Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera. However, the proportion of individuals in each group of flower visitors varied considerably among the sampling months: Hymenoptera (203), Coleoptera (21) in October and Coleoptera (280), Hymenoptera (57) in November. For Hymenoptera, environmental temperature was significant compared to frequency of visitors; whereas for Coleoptera, the number of open flowers per plant has been significant for insect activity. Results show that the visit frequency of pollinators in E. nitens is highly variable within the sampling period and temperature and density of open flowers per plant can produce variations within the group of pollinators.

Seed traits and seed bank longevity of wet sclerophyll forest shrubs	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												In wet sclerophyll forests seedling recruitment either occurs after intermittent fire events or continuously during intervals between fires in gaps created by small-scale disturbances. The dormancy and dispersal characteristics of seeds will influence how plant species exploit these contrasting recruitment opportunities. For example, long-lived seed banks may be crucial for persistence of species that are unable to recruit during intervals between fires if the length of fire intervals exceeds the life span of standing plants (senescence risk). To better understand mechanisms of population persistence during prolonged absence of fire in montane wet sclerophyll forests, we studied seed bank dynamics in four understorey species. We chose two species thought to have fire event-driven recruitment, Banksia integrifolia subsp. monticola (Proteaceae) and Goodia lotifolia (Fabaceae), and two species that are thought to have canopy gap-phase recruitment, Trochocarpa laurina (Ericaceae) and Tasmannia stipitata (Winteraceae). We measured seed rain, seed bank density and used seeds buried in nylon mesh bags to estimate rates of seed decay in the soil over time. All species produced a substantial seed crop on an annual basis. The annual seed crop in three species (G. lotifolia, T. stipitata and T. laurina) was released in a dormant state and developed a persistent seed bank, while one species (B. integrifolia) lacked dormancy and rapidly germinated under laboratory and field conditions. Seed bank characteristics of G. lotifolia appear to promote episodic recruitment after large landscape-scale fires, those of B. integrifolia appear to promote more continuous recruitment in response to smaller fires and other disturbances that avoid widespread mortality of established plants, while seed bank characteristics of T. stipitata and T. laurina may facilitate both episodic and continuous recruitment under respective types of disturbance. The four species appeared to have varied vulnerabilities and mechanisms for reducing immaturity risk and senescence risk to persistence of their populations under recurrent disturbance. Dormancy, seed bank longevity and seed rain are likely to be useful syndromes for predicting the response of wet sclerophyll forest understorey species to changed disturbance regimes.

Australian arid zone grasses have not been explored as sources of modern biomaterials including building materials. Triodia grasslands are a dominant vegetation type in the arid and semiarid regions of Australia covering a third of the continent. Of the 69 identified Triodia species, 26 produce resin from specialised cells in the outer leaf epidermis. In Aboriginal culture, Triodia biomass and resin were valued for their usefulness in cladding shelters and as a hafting agent. Since European settlement, Triodia grasslands have been used for cattle grazing and burning is a common occurrence to improve pasture value and prevent large-scale fires. Although Triodia grasslands are relatively stable to fires, more frequent and large-scale fires impact on other fire sensitive woody and herbaceous species associated with Triodia and invasion of exotic weeds resulting in localised changes in vegetation structure and composition. The extent and change occurring in Triodia grasslands as a result of altered land-use practices, fire regimes, and changing climate warrant careful consideration of their future management. Localised harvesting of Triodia grasslands could have environmental benefits and provide much needed biomaterials for desert living. Research is underway to evaluate the material properties of Triodia biomass and resin in the context of Indigenous and western scientific knowledge. Here, we review uses of Triodia and highlight research needs if sustainable harvesting is to be considered.

Persistent soil seed banks in old-growth Hyrcanian Box tree (Buxus hyrcana) stands in northern Iran	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Little is known about the soil seed bank and the influence of plant communities on the interaction between the seed bank and aboveground vegetation in the Hyrcanian temperate deciduous forest. We surveyed species composition and diversity of the persistent soil seed bank and the aboveground vegetation in six community types in old-growth Hyrcanian Box tree (Buxus hyrcana) stands in northern Iran. Fifty-two species with an average of 3,808 seeds/spores m(-2) germinated; forbs accounted for 64% of the seed bank flora. Thirty-four species in the aboveground vegetation were not presented in the seed bank, 32 species in the seed bank were not found in the vegetation, and 20 species were in both. The dominant tree species were Diospyros lotus and Alnus subcordata with an average of 17 and 4.6 seeds m(-2), respectively. Our results suggest that (1) vernal geophytes and shade-tolerant perennials are not incorporated in the seed bank, (2) early successional species are well represented in the seed bank, (3) plant community type has significant impacts on seed bank densities, and seed bank richness and diversity were significantly related to presence/absence of Box tree in the aboveground vegetation. The persistent seed bank contained species that potentially have a negative impact on the regeneration of forests, thus forest managers should retain old-growth Hyrcanian Box tree stands to conserve disturbance-sensitive indicator forest species.

Does aboveground vegetation composition resemble soil seed bank during succession in specialized vegetation on gypsum soil?	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												This paper evaluates the aboveground vegetation in relation to the soil seed bank throughout a 60-year succession process following agricultural abandonment in a semi-arid Mediterranean gypsum habitat. There is little information regarding the relationship between these two community components in the context of succession on semi-arid gypsum soils. Aboveground vegetation and the corresponding seed bank of gypsum plant communities were sampled through a chronosequence of 24 abandoned fields. Generalized linear models were used to model seed species richness and density, redundancy analyses to model the effect of time since abandonment and the effect of soil physicochemical parameters on seed bank species composition, and Mantel tests to analyze resemblance between above- and belowground species composition. In this last case, the effect of time since abandonment was controlled using a partial Mantel test. Mantel correlograms using time intervals instead of distances were used to describe the resemblance of above-to belowground species occurrence in different aged fields. No significant variability in seed species richness, seed density, or species composition due to time since abandonment was found. Differences in seed species composition were mainly due to small spatial scale predictors such as slope and soil calcium content. High correlations between species composition in the soil seed bank and the aboveground vegetation were detected during succession. The lack of a significant trend in aboveground species replacement over time was also reflected in seed bank composition. We concluded that the rapid establishment of strict gypsophyte species relied mainly on the long-term persistence of these species in the seed bank.

J	Derbile, EK; Kasei, RA				Derbile, Emmanuel Kanchebe; Kasei, Raymond Abudu			Vulnerability of crop production to heavy precipitation in north-eastern Ghana	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT												Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze vulnerability of food crop production to heavy precipitation in north-eastern Ghana, specifically, the upper east region (UER) and the policy implications for adaptation. Heavy precipitation events are a common part of climatic variability; but little attention is given to its impact on livelihoods as compared to droughts in research and policy domains. Design/methodology/approach - This paper draws on both quantitative and qualitative research methods and data. Rainfall data are analyzed using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). This is compared with quantitative analysis of crop yields and complemented by narratives of farmers from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions. Findings - The results show that heavy precipitation events often lead to low food crop productivity and this suggests that the latter is vulnerable to the former. Originality/value - Although some adaptation is occurring through a wide range of local measures, these are inadequate for eliminating vulnerability. Thus, additional policy measures are recommended for enhancing farmer adaptation, including: incorporating climate change adaptation policies, including adaptation to heavy precipitation into District Development Planning; building human resource capacity for effective implementation of climate change adaptation policies at district levels; improving market access to seed through improved market infrastructure and rural transportation; establishing Community Seed Banks (CSBs) as back up sources of seed; promoting "nursing and transplant" as an alternative planting method for millet and guinea corn; promoting low costs solar drying technologies for drying food crops; and supporting livelihood diversification through credit and business development services.																	1756-8692	1756-8706					2012	4	1					36	53		10.1108/17568691211200209							WOS:000302111700003

It becomes especially challenging when the environmental conditions are expected to change in the future, and the optimal management applied today may differ from the management that is optimal under the changed conditions (e.g. due to climate change). This study evaluates prospect of a rare plant species endemic to semi-natural grasslands in central Europe, Gentianella praecox subsp. bohemica. The number of populations of this species has declined rapidly in the last 60 years: currently, a conservation action plan has been established in the Czech Republic, where most populations of this species occur. This study uses periodic matrix models to compare different management regimes under different scenarios of climate change and to identify the optimal management in each case. Without management, populations of the species are not able to survive. Flowering individuals can occur for a long time after the cessation of management, but the extinction of the population is inevitable within several decades. Without management, even very large populations (1000 flowering individuals) will go extinct in less than 50 years. Total extinction (including seed bank) will follow several years after observation of the last flowering plant. The most suitable management is mowing and disturbance (by harrowing), which is also the best method for restoration of threatened populations. Mowing is less suitable, but it is fully sufficient for large prospering populations. When managed, even small populations (10-15 flowering individuals) are able to survive. When management is applied, future climate change may have a relatively small impact on the probability of survival of the species. Climate change will, however, increase the extinction probability of very small populations. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Role of calcium in alleviating effect of salinity on germination of Phragmites karka seeds	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Phragmites karka (Retz.) Trin, ex. steud, a perennial reed with creeping rhizome from the family Poaceae, is distributed as pure population in brackish water swamps. Populations primarily propagate using ramets but also produce numerous seeds which form part of the seed bank after dispersal and are exposed to extremes of temperature, drought, and salinity stress. Seeds were germinated under a range of salinity (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 mM NaCl) and temperature (10/20 degrees C, 15/25 degrees C, 20/30 degrees C, 25/35 degrees C, night/day) regimes in 12 h light:12 h dark photoperiod or in complete darkness with 0, 5, 10, 25 mM CaCl2. Salinity, absence of light and high temperature (25/35 degrees C) reduced germination while calcium generally reversed this effect, more so at cooler temperature regimes. Calcareous soil around Karachi would help alleviate the salinity effect on the germination of P. karka and facilitate its survival. (C) 2011 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A review	AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT												Research has delivered convincing findings on the effect of biodiversity on ecosystem functioning and humankind. Indeed, ecosystems provide provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural services. The global value of annual ecosystem services of grasslands and rangelands is about US$ 232 ha(-1) year(-1). Nevertheless, the precise evaluation of biodiversity benefits remains challenging. This issue is due to valuation methods, subjective assumptions, and complexity of drivers of plant community dynamics. Here, we review the primary factors that influence plant diversity of permanent grasslands, and we describe underlying processes. These factors must indeed be identified to focus policies meant to preserve and restore plant diversity and to advise farmers about efficient decision rules. We show that plant dynamics of permanent grasslands cannot be explained simply by agricultural management rules, e.g., grazing, fertilization, and mowing, implemented at the field scale. The configuration of the surrounding landscape, e.g., landscape heterogeneity, habitat fragmentation, and connectivity, acts as a species filter that defines the regional species pool and controls seed flow. The regional species pool often contains higher species richness in a heterogeneous landscape, because of a higher diversity of suitable habitats. This regional pool could be a major species sources for permanent grasslands according to the seed flow. We discuss the need to consider all of these factors to understand plant species composition of permanent grasslands and the necessity to study plant communities using both taxonomic and functional approaches. In order to report this integrative approach, we propose a conceptual model based on three ecological challenges-dispersal, establishment, and persistence-that are considered to act as filters on plant diversity, and a graphical representation of the complexity of such studies due to the interaction effects between plant dispersal abilities, forage productivity, disturbances induced by farming practices, and landscape heterogeneity on plant diversity. Last, we discuss the ability of farmers to manage each factor and the necessity of such study in the improvement of the current agro-environment schemes efficiency for farmland biodiversity restoration or preservation.																	1774-0746	1773-0155				JAN	2012	32	1					133	160		10.1007/s13593-011-0015-3							WOS:000299748400007

JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												Grassland restoration on former croplands offers good opportunity to mitigate the loss of grassland biodiversity. Weed suppression can be another benefit, which becomes increasingly important because of the high recent rate of abandonment of arable lands in Central and Eastern Europe. Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of sowing two low-diversity seed mixtures followed by annual mowing, a frequently used restoration technique, in weed suppression. We found that rapidly forming cover of sown grasses effectively suppressed short-lived weeds and their germination except in the first year. The detected dense seed bank of short-lived weeds points out the possibility and threat of later weed infestation. In the short run perennial weeds cannot be suppressed easily by sowing and annual mowing. We found that the effectiveness of seed sowing followed by mowing in weed suppression can be different on sites with different history or seed mixture. Rapidly establishing perennial weeds, such as Agropyron species were only detected in former alfalfa fields; Cirsium arvense was found in former cereal and sunflower fields but not in former alfalfa fields. We found that the rate of weed suppression and success was influenced by the seed mixtures used. In several alkali restorations the high proportion of perennial weeds was detected in year 3. In loess restorations, much lower scores were typical. This was likely caused by the different seed mixture used. The loess seed mixture contained seeds of a clonally spreading tall-grass, Bromus inermis, which could compete more effectively with clonally spreading weeds, than could short grass species with or without tussock forming. Our findings indicate that post-restoration management require carefully designed actions that are fine-tuned addressing specific threats at the site level. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Sjursen, H; Brandsaeter, LO; Netland, J				Sjursen, Helge; Brandsaeter, Lars Olav; Netland, Jan			Effects of repeated clover undersowing, green manure ley and weed harrowing on weeds and yields in organic cereals	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE												Cover crops can be used to reduce leaching and erosion, introduce variability into crop rotation and fix nitrogen (N) for use by the main crops, less is however known about effects on weeds. The effects on weed seed bank, weed growth and grain yield of 4 years of annual undersown clover and ryegrass alone and in combination, and one of the 4 years with clover or clover + grass as green manure, were studied in oat and spring wheat at two experimental sites in south-eastern Norway. These treatments were compared with no undersown crop (control) and with weed harrowing. In contrast to many results in the literature, the undersown clover in this study did not suppress annual weeds, but fertilized the weeds as well as the cereals. Undersown clover resulted in a statistically significant increase of grain yield at the two sites to 116% and 121% of control. During the 4-year period relative seed bank and density of emerged weed (dominated by Spergula arvensis) increased significantly about 4.5 and 10 times respectively in the undersown clover plots at Apelsvoll. At Kise both ryegrass alone and ryegrass mixed with clover significantly suppressed the weed biomass to 70% and 74% of control respectively. It is concluded that fertilization effects of undersown clover may have dominated and overriden the competitive effects. One whole-season clover green manure did not increase the mean yield, but resulted in a significant drop in seed bank size the following year, because of limited weed establishment in an established ley. Only a slight increase in average weed biomass was observed at one of the two experimental sites. The weed seed bank and the weed biomass were essentially kept at steady state during the experimental period in harrowed plots, but harrowing decreased grain yield significantly at both sites.																	0906-4710						2012	62	2					138	150		10.1080/09064710.2011.584550							WOS:000299909900006

By late spring, this annual plant has dispersed its seed and died; its aboveground biomass then becomes fine fuel that burns as frequently as once every 3-5 y in its invaded range. Cheatgrass has proven to be better adapted to fire there than many competing plants, but the contribution of its fungal symbionts to this adaptation had not previously been studied. In sampling cheatgrass endophytes, many fire-associated fungi were found, including Morchella in three western states (New Mexico, Idaho, and Washington). In greenhouse experiments, a New Mexico isolate of Morchella increased both the biomass and fecundity of its local cheatgrass population, thus simultaneously increasing both the probability of fire and survival of that event, via more fuel and a greater, belowground seed bank, respectively. Re-isolation efforts proved that Morchella could infect cheatgrass roots in a non-mycorrhizal manner and then grow up into aboveground tissues. The same Morchella isolate also increased survival of seed exposed to heat typical of that which develops in the seed bank during a cheatgrass fire. Phylogenetic analysis of Eurasian and North American Morchella revealed that this fire-associated mutualism was evolutionarily novel, in that cheatgrass isolates belonged to two phylogenetically distinct species, or phylotypes, designated Me1-6 and Mel-12 whose evolutionary origin appears to be within western North America. Mutualisms with fire-associated fungi may be contributing to the cheatgrass invasion of western North America. (C) 2011 British Mycological Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Maternal Corn Environment Influences Wild-Proso Millet (Panicum miliaceum) Seed Characteristics	WEED SCIENCE												Modification of the cropping environment to make weed seed more susceptible to fatal germination or decay processes is based, in part, on the premise that seed longevity is affected by the crop-influenced environment in which seed is produced, hereafter, called the maternal crop environment. The objective of this investigation was to determine the influence of maternal crop environment on wild-proso millet seed production, germinability, and seed coat tone (i.e., lightness), a trait previously associated with seed longevity in wild-proso millet. Maternal corn environments were established by growing wild-proso millet plants in four morphologically different sweet corn hybrids in four replicates over 2 yr. Wild-proso millet seed was collected at sweet corn harvest, enumerated, characterized for seed coat tone, and tested for germination. Principal component factor analysis reduced six sweet corn traits measured between silking and harvest into a single maternal corn environment factor that accounted for 84% of the variation among crop canopies. Functional relationships between maternal corn environment factor scores and wild-proso millet seed characteristics were clarified by fitting linear models. For each unit decrease in maternal environment factor score, wild-proso millet seed production increased 1,535 seed m(-2), germination increased 2.2%, and seed coat tone was 1.8% lighter. These results show the size and germinability of wild-proso millet seed was highest in less-competitive maternal corn environments characterized by a short time to crop maturity and a small crop-canopy size.																	0043-1745					JAN-MAR	2012	60	1					69	74		10.1614/WS-D-11-00098.1							WOS:000299668200011

Metapopulations and metacommunities: combining spatial and temporal perspectives in plant ecology	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Metapopulation and metacommunity theories occupy a central role in ecology, but can be difficult to apply to plants. Challenges include whether seed dispersal is sufficient for population connectivity, the role of seed banks and problems with studying colonization and extinction in long-lived and clonal plants. Further, populations often do not occupy discrete habitat patches. Despite these difficulties, we present case studies to illustrate explicit integration of spatial and temporal data in plant ecology.																	0022-0477	1365-2745				JAN	2012	100	1					88	103		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01917.x							WOS:000298014400008

Damages may arise through formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in gametophytes of ecologically important kelps, brown algae of the order Laminariales, Such stress-induced damages may have a negative impact on their fitness and further impact their following life stages. In our study, gametophytes of three kelp species Alaria esculenta (L.) Grev., Laminaria digitata (Huds.) Lamour., Saccharina latissima (L.) Lane, Mayes, Druehl, Saunders from the Arctic, and of L. hyperborea (Gunnerus) Foslie from the North Sea were exposed to photosynthetically active radiation, UV-A, and UV-B radiation and four temperatures (218 degrees C). ROS are formed predominantly in the peripheral cytoplasm and in chloroplasts especially after exposure to UVR. Superoxide (O2*-) is additionally formed in small, globular cytoplasmic structures, possibly mitochondria. In the surrounding medium O2*--concentration increased markedly at elevated temperatures and under UV stress in some cases. Ultrastructural damage was negligible pointing to a high stress tolerance of this developmental stage. Our data indicate that stress tolerant gametophytes of three Arctic kelp species should sustain their crucial function as seed bank for kelp populations even under prospective rising environmental perturbations.

These conditions pose a challenge to the regulation of germination. The effect of recurring hydration-dehydration (Hy-Dh) cycles were tested on seeds from four Arabidopsis thaliana accessions [Col-0, Cvi, C24 and Ler]. Diurnal Hy-Dh cycles had a detrimental effect on the germination rate and on the final percentage of germination in Col-0, Cvi and C24 ecotypes, but not in the Ler ecotype, which showed improved vigor following the treatments. Membrane permeability measured by ion conductivity was generally increased following each Hy-Dh cycle and was correlated with changes in the redox status represented by the GSSG/GSH (oxidized/reduced glutathione) ratio. Among the ecotypes, Col-0 seeds displayed the highest membrane permeability, whilst Ler was characterized by the greatest increase in electrical conductivity following Hy-Dh cycles. Following Dh 2 and Dh 3, the respiratory activity of Ler seeds significantly increased, in contrast to the other ecotypes, indicative of a dramatic shift in metabolism. These differences were associated with accession-specific content and patterns of change of (i) cell wall-related laminaribiose and mannose; (ii) fatty acid composition, specifically of the unsaturated oleic acid and alpha-linoleic acid; and (iii) asparagine, ornithine and the related polyamine putrescine. Furthermore, in the Ler ecotype the content of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates fumarate, succinate and malate increased in response to dehydration, in contrast to a decrease in the other three ecotypes. These findings provide a link between seed respiration, energy metabolism, fatty acid beta-oxidation, nitrogen mobilization and membrane permeability and the improved germination of Ler seeds following Hy-Dh cycles.

Soil seed bank recovery occurs more rapidly than expected in semi-arid Mediterranean gypsum vegetation	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Seed banks are critical in arid ecosystems and ensure the persistence of species. Despite the importance of seed banks, knowledge about their formation and the extent to which a seed bank can recover after severe perturbation remains scarce. If undisturbed, soil seed banks reflect a long vegetation history; therefore, we would expect that new soil seed banks and those of undisturbed soils require long periods to become similar with respect to both density and composition. In contrast, if soil seed banks are only a short- to midterm reservoir in which long-term accumulation constitutes only a tiny fraction, they will recover rapidly from the vegetation. To shed light on this question, we evaluated seed bank formation in a semi-arid gypsum community. Methods Soils from 300 plots were replaced with sterilized soil in an undisturbed semi-arid Mediterranean community. Seasonal changes in seed bank density and composition were monitored for 3 years by comparing paired sterilized and control soil samples at each plot. Key Results Differences in seed bank density between sterilized and control soil disappeared after 18 months. The composition of sterilized seed banks was correlated with that of the control plots from the first sampling date, and both were highly correlated with vegetation. Nearly 24% of the seed bank density could be attributed to secondary dispersal. Most seeds died before emergence (66.41-71.33 %), whereas the rest either emerged (14.08-15.48 %) or persisted in the soil (14.59-18.11 %). Conclusions Seed banks can recover very rapidly even under the limiting and stressful conditions of semi-arid environments. This recovery is based mainly on the seed rain at small scales together with secondary dispersal from intact seed banks in the vicinity. These results emphasize the relevance of processes occurring on short spatial scales in determining community structure.

J	Fernandez-Aparicio, M; Rubiales, D				Fernandez-Aparicio, Monica; Rubiales, Diego			Differential response of pea (Pisum sativum) to Orobanche crenata, Orobanche foetida and Phelipanche aegyptiaca	CROP PROTECTION												Several broomrape species including Orobanche crenata, Orobanche foetida and Phelipanche aegyptiaca are reported to infect various grain and forage legumes in the Mediterranean and West Asia. Pea (Pisum sativum) is severely damaged by O. crenata, but there are no reports on O. foetida or P aegyptiaca infection. We report here that pea can induce high germination of seeds of O. crenata, O. foetida and P aegyptiaca but only O. crenata success infecting pea roots and developing further. Some differences in levels of infection by O. crenata were observed among pea accessions what can be exploited in pea resistance breeding programmes. On the contrary, all pea accessions studied were highly resistant to infection by both O. foetida and P. aegyptiaca, preventing any tubercle attachment and development. This makes pea a promising candidate as trap crop for O. foetida and P. aegyptiaca seed bank demise in infested soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Judson			Characterization and ecological implication of eelgrass life history strategies near the species' southern limit in the western North Atlantic	MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES												Eelgrass Zostera marina L. populations located near the species southern limit in the western North Atlantic were assessed monthly from July 2007 through November 2008. We identified (1) dominant life history strategies and local environmental conditions in southern Z. marina populations, (2) quantified differences in reproductive phenology between populations and different local environmental conditions, and (3) compared reproductive strategies to established annual and perennial life history paradigms. Observed populations expressed both life history strategies with one Z. marina population completely losing aboveground biomass and reestablishing from seeds (annual model) while another population retained aboveground biomass throughout the year (perennial model). A third life history strategy, characterized here as a mixed-annual population, was also observed after some seedlings were found to reproduce both sexually and asexually during their first year of growth thereby not conforming to any currently established life history paradigm. Development of multiple life history strategies within this region may be in response to stressful summer water temperatures associated with the southern edge of the species' range. We suggest that neither annual nor perennial life history strategies always provide a superior mechanism for population persistence as perennial populations can be susceptible to multiple consecutive years of stress, and annual populations are unable to fully exploit available resources throughout much of the year. The mixed-annual strategy observed here represents another possible life history model which may provide the mechanism necessary for Z. marina populations to persist during times of environmental transition.

Litter effects on seedling establishment interact with seed position and earthworm activity	PLANT BIOLOGY												Seedling establishment is influenced by litter cover and by seed predators, but little is known about interactions between these two factors. We tested their effects on emergence of five typical grassland species in a microcosm experiment. We manipulated the amounts of grass litter, seed sowing position and earthworm activity to determine whether: (i) the protective effect of litter against seed predation depends on cover amount and seed sowing position, i.e., on top or beneath litter; (ii) seed transport by earthworms changes the effect of seed sowing position on seedling emergence; and (iii) seeds transported into deeper soil layers by earthworms are still germinable. Litter cover and presence of earthworms lowered seedling emergence. The impact of seed position increased with seed size. Emergence of large-seeded species was reduced when sown on the surface. Additionally, we found an important seed position x earthworm interaction related to seed size. Emergence of large-seeded species sown on top of the litter was up to three times higher when earthworms were present than without earthworms. Earthworms also significantly altered the depth distribution of seeds in the soil and across treatments: on average 6% of seeds germinated after burial. In contrast to the seed position effect, we found no size effect on mobility and germinability of seeds after burial in the soil. Nevertheless, the fate of different-sized seeds may differ. While burial will remove large seeds from the regeneration pool, it may enhance seed bank build up in small-seeded species. Consequently, changes in the amount of litter cover and the invertebrate community play a significant role in plant community composition.

We analyzed the genetic variations of 440 samples exhaustively collected from nine O. officinalis populations. Relatively rich clonal diversity and poor genetic variation were found in the extant populations. We found that the number of genets, the percentage of polymorphic loci, and gene diversity decreased with population decline, suggesting that habitat degradation will lead to further genetic depletion of O. officinalis populations. A pronounced spatial genetic structure occurs at both the ramet and genet levels in several larger populations, which is the result of clonal growth and concomitant inbreeding. The in situ conserved population PS holds much more genotypes than other populations with the similar population size, which might have more seedling recruitments from the soil seed bank due to habitat disturbance, suggesting a moderate disturbance combined with habitat degradation-avoiding measures are effective for in situ conservation of this species.

Explosive Pulsed Power Experimental Capability at LLNL	2012 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MEGAGAUSS MAGNETIC FIELD GENERATION AND RELATED TOPICS (MEGAGUSS)					14th International Conference on Megagauss Magnetic Field Generation and Related Topics (MEGAGAUSS)	OCT 14-19, 2012	Maui, HI	IEEE, MG Inst Inc, US & Russian labs, European & Chinese labs, IEEE Nucl & Plasma Sci Soc, IEEE Pulsed Power Sci & Technol Comm				LLNL has developed a family of advanced magnetic flux compression generators (FCGs) used to perform high energy density physics experiments and material science studies. In recent years we have performed these experiments at explosive test sites in New Mexico and Nevada. In 2011, we re-established an explosive pulsed power test facility closer to Livermore. LLNL's Site 300 is a U.S. DOE-NNSA experimental test site situated on 7000 acres in rural foothills approximately 15 miles southeast of Livermore. It was established in 1955 as a non-nuclear explosives test facility to support LLNL's national security mission. On this site there are numerous facilities for fabricating, storing, assembling, and testing explosive devices. Site 300 is also home to some of DOE's premier facilities for hydrodynamic testing, with sophisticated diagnostics such as high-speed imaging, flash X-ray radiography, and other advanced diagnostics for performing unique experiments such as shock physics experiments, which examine how materials behave under high pressure and temperature. We have converted and upgraded one particular firing bunker at Site 300 (known as Bunker 851) to provide the necessary infrastructure to support high explosive pulsed power (HEPP) experiments. In doing so, we were able to incorporate our established practices for handling grounding, shielding, and isolation of auxiliary systems and diagnostics, in order to effectively manage the large voltages produced by FCGs, and minimize unwanted coupling to diagnostic data. This paper will discuss some of the key attributes of the Bunker 851 facility, including the specialized firesets and isolated initiation systems for multistage explosive systems, a detonator-switched seed bank that operates while isolated from earth and building ground, a fiber-optic based timing, triggering and control system, an EMI Faraday cage that completely encloses diagnostic sensors, cabling and high-resolution digitizers, optical fiber-based velocimetry and current sensor systems, and a flash X-ray radiography system. The photos and experimental results from recent FCG experiments will also be shown and discussed.																			978-1-4673-5720-3				2012																	WOS:000393288600030

The influence of Pechuel-Loeschea leubnitziae (wild sage) on grass sward and soil seed bank composition	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												Soil seed banks provide not only a historical record of vegetation composition but also the potential for post-disturbance revegetation. Pechuel-Loeschea leubnitziae (wild sage) is a multistemmed, aromatic shrub, occurring in Namibia, Botswana, Swaziland, Zimbabwe and the northern regions of South Africa, that colonises disturbed regions on sandy, alkaline soils. The influence of differing levels of P. leubnitziae cover on soil seed-bank characteristics and aboveground herbaceous species composition was determined by examining aboveground species composition, recorded in the field, and soil seed-bank species composition, determined by recording germinations from topsoil samples collected at each of 104 sites in the southern Okavango Delta. No correlation was observed between aboveground and soil seed-bank composition (p = 0.209). Cover of P. leubnitziae did not affect soil seed-bank species composition (p = 0.31) or the grass: non-grass ratio within the seed bank (p = 0.308). It did, however, affect aboveground grass composition (p = 0.018), with increasing P. leubnitziae cover associated with increasing abundance of poor-quality, shade-tolerant grass species. This confirms the observations that encroachment of P. leubnitziae may be associated with a decrease in veld quality and carrying capacity, and highlights the necessity for further study to facilitate a better understanding of the species for management purposes.

Aerial seed bank and dispersal traits in Anthemis chrysantha (Asteraceae), a critically endangered species	FLORA												Mature plant density and fruit production were monitored in the main population of four successive cohorts of the endangered winter annual Anthemis chrysantha (Asteraceae) in southeastern Spain. Experiments were conducted with artificial rainfall and a wind tunnel to determine the temporal and spatial dispersal pattern of the species and the relationship with rain and wind. The population fluctuations of A. chrysantha observed during 2006-2009 could be explained by the rainfall amount and seasonal distribution, which in turn influenced the production of achenes. This study demonstrated the formation of a seasonal aerial seed bank that remains on the dead plant from the fruiting period (early summer) to late spring. We experimentally demonstrated that rain was necessary to release the achenes from the capitula (ombrohydrochory), with wind having no effect on dispersal. The pattern of achene release was related to rainfall events. The main timing of dispersal was during autumn, decreasing the aerial bank by around 80% by December. However, in March, when the next cohort was flowering, some achenes still remained on old capitula (up to 1700 achenes per m(2) in some years). White non-dormant achenes were first released, and dark dormant achenes were released later. The non-dormant achenes on the soil surface could germinate quickly (2 d) after receiving a minimum of 10 mm of rainfall at autumn temperatures. Most achenes dispersed across very short distances (atelechory): 75% of them landed beneath the plant canopy and only 7% landed >30 cm from the canopy edge. Results suggest that a seasonal aerial seed bank is an effective trait to ensure the maintenance of this species in its unpredictable habitat. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Kissmann, C; Tozzi, HH; Martins, S; Habermann, G				Kissmann, Camila; Tozzi, Henrique H.; Martins, Shirley; Habermann, Gustavo			Germination performance of congeneric Styrax species from the Cerrado sensu lato areas and their distribution pattern in different physiognomies	FLORA												When studying congeneric species, it is of reasonable importance to understand different ecophysiological performances which might determine the distribution of species in habitats with different natural resources. Styrax ferrugineus is exclusive and well adapted to the Brazilian Cerrado sensu stricto (s. str.); S. camporum is widely distributed in the Cerrado sensu lato (s.l.) areas, with young trees being observed at the edge of cerradao and other vegetation fragments; and S. pohlii occurs in permanently waterlogged soils of the Cerrado region, such as those of riparian forests. We tested the hypothesis that the higher the soil water content in the physiognomic gradient of the vegetation, the higher is the germination success of S. pohlii, but the lower is the germination success of S. ferrugineus. We also discuss whether gap conditions inside a cerradao fragment imply a high germination rates of seeds of S. camporum. Seeds from each of the three species were buried within nylon bags containing soil from the respective sites. Burial occurred in a Cerrado s. str., in understory and gap conditions of a cerradao, and in the understory of a riparian forest fragment, and lasted for 60, 120, 180 and 240 days, respectively, after the fruit dispersal time of each of the three species. After 60 days, a relationship was found showing that the percentage of germinated seeds diminished, and the percentage of damaged seeds increased as soil water content increased (Cerrado s. str. < cerradao gap < cerradao understory << riparian forest). S. camporum still showed viable seeds 60 days after burial (DAB), and germinated seeds 120 DAB, indicating that it needed a longer time to germinate, which might be associated to its thicker seed coat, in relation to the other two species. The germination performance of each of the three species was the same in the gap and understory conditions of the cerradao. The higher concentration of adult S. camporum plants at the edge of vegetation fragments is not related to a particular high germination performance and seedling establishment.

Management of the Invasive Hill Raspberry (Rubus niveus) on Santiago Island, Galapagos: Eradication or Indefinite Control?	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												The eradication of an invasive plant species can provide substantial ecological and economic benefits by eliminating completely the negative effects of the weed and reducing the high cost of continuing control. A 5-yr program toward the eradication of hill raspberry (Rubus niveus Thunb.) in Santiago Island is evaluated using delimitation and extirpation criteria, as well as assessment of the ecological community response to management techniques. Currently, hill raspberry is located in the humid zone of Santiago island. It is distributed over three main infestations, small patches, and many scattered individuals within an area of approximately 1,000 ha. New infestations are constantly being found; every year, new detections add an area of approximately 175 ha. Adult and juvenile individuals are still found, both beyond and within known infestations. Both plant and seed bank density of hill raspberry decreased over time where infestations were controlled. Species composition in the seed bank and existing vegetation were significantly different between areas under intensive control and adjacent uninvaded forest. After 5 yr of intensive management, delimitation of hill raspberry has not been achieved; new populations are found every year, increasing the infested area that requires management. Off-target effects on native species resulting from control efforts seem to be substantial. Although a vast increase in economic investment would allow intensive searching that might enable all individuals to be found and controlled, the resultant disturbance and off-targets effects could outweigh the conservation benefits of eradication.

Integrated Management of Scotch Broom (Cytisus scoparius) Using Biological Control	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Integrated weed management strategies (IWM) are being advocated and employed to control invasive plants species. In this study, we compared three management strategies (biological control alone [BC], BC with fire [BC + F] and BC with mowing [BC + M]) to determine if physical controls reduce seed production by Scotch broom and interfere with the action of the biological control agent the Scotch broom seed weevil. We measured seed production and seed predation by the weevil at both pod and plant scale, and seed bank density over two field seasons. We found no difference in the number of seeds per pod among management strategies. However, combining management strategies (BC + M and BC + F) resulted in significant reductions in pods per plant, mature seeds per plant, and seed bank density relative to biological control alone. We did not find differences among management strategies in number of weevils per pod or proportion of seeds predated by the weevil at either pod or whole-plant scale. However, combining management strategies (BC + M and BC + F) resulted in a significant reduction in healthy mature seeds per plant relative to biological control alone. Although both integrated strategies outperformed biological control alone in reducing seed production and the seed bank, with no statistical difference between them, we propose that short-rotation prescribed fire could prove to be a more effective strategy for long-term management of Scotch broom due to its potential for slightly greater depletion of the seed bank.

Makiling Forest Reserve, Philippines	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												We compared soil seed banks between a secondary natural forest and an adjacent big leaf mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla King) plantation in the Mt. Makiling Forest Reserve, Philippines to understand seed bank dynamics, the relationship between soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation and effects of canopy gaps on soil seed banks in a tropical rain forest. Stand inventorying was conducted and soil seed bank composition and density were examined in February and August 2008. Seeds were germinated to identify the species. Aboveground species composition and small canopy gaps little influenced soil seed bank composition and density. Only three species in the secondary natural forest and six species in the big leaf mahogany plantation were commonly found in both soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation. Most species in soil seed banks were pioneer or mid seral species which came from the outside of the stands. The dominant species in soil seed banks were mid seral species in the secondary natural forest and pioneer species in the big leaf mahogany plantation. Differences in soil seed bank composition and density were greater between stands than between gap closure levels, implying little effects of small canopy gaps on soil seed bank composition and density in the study sites. The low soil seed bank density of late seral species suggests that soil seed bank may not be the major source of late seral species regeneration while high soil seed bank density of pioneer and mid seral species implies that soil seed bank can be critical in the regeneration of pioneer and mid seral species in tropical rain forests.																	0119-1144						2012					1		47	59									WOS:000305846200005

Seed rain and soil seed banks limit native regeneration within urban forest restoration plantings in Hamilton City, New Zealand	NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Restoration of native forest vegetation in urban environments may be limited due to isolation from native seed sources and to the prevalence of exotic plant species. To investigate urban seed availability we recorded the composition of seed rain, soil seed banks and vegetation at native forest restoration plantings up to 36 years old in Hamilton City and compared these with naturally regenerating forest within the city and in a nearby rural native forest remnant. Seed rain, soil seed banks (fern spores inclusive) and understorey vegetation in urban forest were found to have higher exotic species richness and lower native species density and richness than rural forest. Both understorey vegetation and soil seed banks of urban sites >20 years old had lower exotic species richness than younger (10-20 years) sites, indicating a developmental threshold that provided some resistance to exotic species establishment. However, the prevalence of exotic species in urban seed rain will allow reinvasion through edge habitat and following disturbance to canopy vegetation. Persistent soil seed banks from both urban and rural sites were dominated by exotic herbaceous species and native fern species, while few other native forest species were found to persist for >1 year in the seed bank. Enrichment planting will be required for those native species with limited dispersal or short-lived seeds, thus improving native seed availability in urban forests as more planted species mature reproductively. Further research into species seed traits and seedling establishment is needed to refine effective management strategies for successful restoration of urban native forests.																	0110-6465	1177-7788					2012	36	2					177	190									WOS:000306678600008

Different ant species create nests varying in structure and size, and tend to have a variety of feeding strategies. Differences in food imported to the nest and contrasting nesting behaviour may control soil microbial community structure in nest soil, with cascading effects on nutrient cycling, but this has not been tested in grassland ants. Soil and ants were sampled from nests of three ant species: two formicines; Lasius flavus (aphid farmer/scavenger, mound builder) and Formica lemani (scavenger/hunter, non-mound builder), and a myrmicine; Myrmica sabuleti (hunter/scavenger, non-mound builder), in an extensively grazed temperate grassland and compared to similar soils without ants. Microbial assemblages were determined using molecular approaches (terminal restriction length polymorphism and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis). Both aboveground (vegetation diversity) and belowground (soil physico-chemical properties) components were measured to assess the potential of the different ant species to modify the environment. Stable isotope ratios (delta C-13 and delta N-15) of ant tissues and nest soil organic matter confirmed differences in trophic distances. Significant changes in soil pH, moisture content, total C and total N. and in vegetation composition, demonstrated ant ecosystem engineering effects. In turn, nests of I.. flavus, M. sabuleti and F. lemani had different microbial activities and harboured significantly different microbial assemblages ( total bacteria, total fungi, ammonia-oxidising bacteria and nitrogen-fixing bacteria), but the diversity was similar. These findings suggest that grassland ants can control microbial assemblages via changes in physical and biological soil characteristics in their nests, and as such, different ant species harbour unique microbial assemblages in nests.

J	Volis, S				Volis, Sergei			Demographic consequences of delayed germination in two annual grasses from two locations of contrasting aridity	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Delayed seed germination is considered to be a bet-hedging strategy, but experimental evidence of its adaptive role as an inherited trait is still lacking. In each of two co-occuring annual grass species, populations of Mediterranean and desert origin were studied during three consecutive years for population demography and seed germination in the reciprocally introduced experimental soil seed banks. The two environments strikingly differed in productivity (annual rainfall) and predictability (variation in amount and timing of annual rainfall). The two species exhibited highly similar pattern of seed size and dormancy across the two environments. In both species, a higher proportion of dormant seeds was observed at the desert location and for the seeds of desert origin, consistent with bet-hedging buffering against unpredictability of rainfall and high probability of drought in this environment. In addition, in both species seed mass was significantly less in plants of desert origin than in plants of Mediterranean origin. The two environments differed in demographic consequences of temporal variation in precipitation. In the Mediterranean population, even in the year of least precipitation, adults grew to maturity and seeds were produced. These seeds served to maintain population size. In contrast, in the desert population, in the year of least rainfall no seedlings survived to maturity and the soil seed bank was the only source of population persistence. Altogether, the results concur with predicted by adaptive bet hedging importance of delayed germination under marginal precipitation. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH.

Plant invasions, restoration, and economics: Perspectives from South African fynbos	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Restoration is gaining importance in the management of plant invasions. As the success of restoration projects is frequently determined by factors other than ecological ones, we explored the ecological and financial feasibility of active restoration on three different invaded sites in South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. The aim of our study was to identify cost-effective ways of restoring functional native ecosystems following invasion by alien plants. Over three years we evaluated different restoration approaches using field trials and experimental manipulations (i.e. mechanical clearing, burning, different soil restoration techniques and sowing of native species) to reduce elevated soil nutrient levels and to re-establish native fynbos communities. Furthermore we investigated the possibility of introducing native fynbos species that can be used for sustainable harvesting to create an incentive for restoration on private land. Diversity and evenness of native plant species increased significantly after restoration at all three sites, whereas cover of alien plants decreased significantly, confirming that active restoration was successful. However, sowing of native fynbos species had no significant effect on native cover, species richness, diversity or evenness in the Acacia thicket and Kikuyu field, implying that the ecosystem was sufficiently resilient to allow autogenic recovery following clearing and burning of the invasive species. Soil restoration treatments resulted in an increase of available nitrogen in the Acacia thicket, but had no significant effects in the Eucalyptus plantation. However, despite elevated available soil nitrogen levels, native species germinated irrespective whether sown or unsown (i.e. regeneration from the soil seed bank). Without active introduction of native species, native grasses, forbs and other shrubs would have dominated, and proteoids and ericoids (the major fynbos growth forms) would have been under-represented. The financial analysis shows that income from flower harvesting following active restoration consistently outweighs income following passive restoration, but that the associated increase in income does not always justify the higher costs. We conclude that active restoration can be effective and financially feasible when compared to passive restoration, depending on the density of invasion. Active restoration of densely invaded sites may therefore only be justifiable if the target area is in a region of high conservation priority. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Local filters limit species diversity, but species pools determine composition	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												In a series of three experiments, we tested for effects of species pools, resource stress, and species interactions on four aspects of community structure: species richness, evenness, species composition, and functional group composition. We also examined whether the impacts of species interactions on the community varied with resource availability or species pool. Communities of sand dune annuals grew from seed bank samples collected from two sites in three different years, so that the species pool differed at two levels: the source site and the year of seed bank collection. Communities experienced one of three irrigation treatments and a range of sowing densities, which varied resource supply (stress) and the potential for species interactions, respectively. Species richness and evenness were most affected by local factors: higher densities and lower water availability decreased species diversity. In contrast, species composition was influenced most by the species pool. Functional group composition had an intermediate response, and was affected by both species pools and local filters. Resource stress and species interactions strongly filtered species from the community, but the identity of species remaining was variable. Furthermore, the magnitude of species interaction effects on richness and evenness varied with species pools. Thus, the outcome of species sorting among biotic and abiotic environments was dependent on the pool of available species. Contrary to predictions from theory, the effects of species interactions on the community did not vary consistently with resource levels. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, XJ; Baskin, JM; Baskin, CC; Huang, ZY				Yang, Xuejun; Baskin, Jerry M.; Baskin, Carol C.; Huang, Zhenying			More than just a coating: Ecological importance, taxonomic occurrence and phylogenetic relationships of seed coat mucilage	PERSPECTIVES IN PLANT ECOLOGY EVOLUTION AND SYSTEMATICS												Studies on the ecological importance of seed coat mucilage have provided valuable information about its roles in critical stages of the plant life cycle. Seed mucilage may, by providing a moist environment and maintaining metabolic activity in the seed, promote seed development. In seed dispersal, seed mucilage influences topochory, epizoochory, endozoochory and hydrochory by anchorage of seeds to soil surface, lubrication or changing the specific weight of the seed. In arid environments, seed mucilage can prevent seeds from drying or initiate DNA repair mechanisms, thereby maintaining the soil seed bank. Seed mucilage reduces oxygen diffusion to the seed and thus has a role in regulating seed dormancy. Due to it being hydrophilous, acting as a physical barrier and containing chemicals, seed mucilage is proposed to promote seed germination in favorable environments. In seedling growth, seed mucilage may lubricate the radicle as it penetrates the soil and be degraded by soil microfloras and thus promote seedling growth. Further investigation of seed mucilage for more species in diverse habitats from the perspectives of evolution, genetics, proteomics, phylogeny and plant-microbe interactions would contribute substantially to our understanding about its ecological importance.

It holds about 3 million records of vascular plants, dating from 1800 till present. Furthermore, it includes ecological data on vascular plant species, redlist category information, Ellenberg values, legal status, global distribution, seed bank etc. The database is an initiative of "Flo.Wer" (www.plantenwerkgroep.be), the Research Institute for Nature and Forest (INBO: www.inbo.be) and the National Botanic Garden of Belgium (www.brigov.be). Florabank aims at centralizing botanical distribution data gathered by both professional and amateur botanists and to make these data available to the benefit of nature conservation, policy and scientific research. The occurrence data contained in Florabank1 are extracted from checklists, literature and herbarium specimen information. Of survey lists, the locality name (verbatimLocality), species name, observation date and IFBL square code, the grid system used for plant mapping in Belgium (Van Rompaey 1943), is recorded. For records dating from the period 1972-2004 all pertinent botanical journals dealing with Belgian flora were systematically screened. Analysis of herbarium specimens in the collection of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium, the University of Ghent and the University of Liege provided interesting distribution knowledge concerning rare species, this information is also included in Florabank1. The data recorded before 1972 is available through the Belgian GBIF node (http://data.gbif.org/datasets/resource/10969/), not through FLORABANK1, to avoid duplication of information. A dedicated portal providing access to all published Belgian IFBL records at this moment is available at: http://projects.biodiversity.be/ifbl All data in Florabank1 is georeferenced. Every record holds the decimal centroid coordinates of the IFBL square containing the observation. The uncertainty radius is the smallest circle possible covering the whole IFBL square, which can measure 1 Km(2) or 4 Km(2). Florabank is a work in progress and new occurrences are added as they become available; the dataset will be updated through GBIF on a regularly base.

Comparison of Herbicides for Reducing Annual Grass Emergence in Two Great Basin Soils	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Reducing seed germination and seedling emergence of downy brome (Bromus tectorum L.) improves the success of revegetating degraded shrubland ecosystems. While pre-emergence herbicides can potentially reduce these two processes, their impact on germination and emergence of downy brome and revegetation species in semiarid ecosystems is poorly understood and has not been comprehensively studied in soils with potentially contrasting herbicide bioavailability (i.e., residual plant activity). We designed a greenhouse experiment to evaluate the effects two pre-emergence acetolactate synthase inhibiting herbicides (rimsulfuron and imazapic) on germination and emergence of downy brome and two revegetation grass species (crested wheatgrass [Agropyron cristatum {L.} Gaertn.] and bottlebrush squirreltail [Elymus elymoides {Raf.} Swezey]) that were grown in representative soils from salt desert and sagebrush shrublands. Pre-emergence herbicides significantly (P < 0.05) reduced seedling emergence and biomass production of downy brome and crested wheatgrass and increased mortality more so in sagebrush compared to salt desert soil, suggesting that these common Great Basin soils fundamentally differ in herbicide bioavailability. Also, germination and emergence of the two highly responsive species (crested wheatgrass and downy brome) were clearly more impacted by rimsulfuron than imazapic. We discuss these results in terms of how the specific soil physiochemical properties influence herbicide adsorption and leaching. Our results shed new light on the relative performance of these two promising herbicides and the importance of considering soil properties when applying pre-emergence herbicides to reduce germination and emergence of invasive annual grasses and create suitable seedbed conditions for revegetation.

Supplementing Seed Banks to Rehabilitate Disturbed Mojave Desert Shrublands: Where Do All the Seeds Go?	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Revegetation of degraded arid lands often involves supplementing impoverished seed banks and improving the seedbed, yet these approaches frequently fail. To understand these failures, we tracked the fates of seeds for six shrub species that were broadcast across two contrasting surface disturbances common to the Mojave Desertsites compacted by concentrated vehicle use and trenched sites where topsoil and subsurface soils were mixed. We evaluated seedbed treatments that enhance soil-seed contact (tackifier) and create surface roughness while reducing soil bulk density (harrowing). We also explored whether seed harvesting by granivores and seedling suppression by non-native annuals influence the success of broadcast seeding in revegetating degraded shrublands. Ten weeks after treatments, seeds readily moved off of experimental plots in untreated compacted sites, but seed movements were reduced 32% by tackifier and 55% through harrowing. Harrowing promoted seedling emergence in compacted sites, particularly for the early-colonizing species Encelia farinosa, but tackifier was largely ineffective. The inherent surface roughness of trenched sites retained three times the number of seeds than compacted sites, but soil mixing during trench development likely altered the suitability of the seedbed thus resulting in poor seedling emergence. Non-native annuals had little influence on seed fates during our study. In contrast, the prevalence of harvester ants increased seed removal on compacted sites, whereas rodent activity influenced removal on trenched sites. Future success of broadcast seeding in arid lands depends on evaluating disturbance characteristics prior to seeding and selecting appropriate species and seasons for application.

Owen			The Influence of Time on the Soil Seed Bank and Vegetation across a Landscape-Scale Wetland Restoration Project	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve (NNR) in Cambridgeshire, U.K. is a wetland of international importance isolated in a landscape dominated by arable farming. The prospect of species extinctions within the NNR led to the creation of the Wicken Fen Vision, an ambitious project that will eventually expand the reserve boundary by the purchase and restoration of c.50 km2 of arable land. We sampled three fields from each of three distinct age-categories of restoration land (5, 15, and 60 years post-arable), and three fields within the adjacent, undrained NNR, to determine (1) differences in seed bank composition across age-categories, (2) relationships between restoration age, the seed bank and standing vegetation, and (3) changes in species traits across age-categories. Historic arable management contributed to an apparent vertical mixing effect in the seed bank of the youngest two age-categories, with associated and significant differences in species functional traits across the study area. Almost all plants associated with NNR vegetation were absent from restoration area seed banks and standing vegetation. Seed bank species common to all ages-categories exhibited a bias toward moderate to high Ellenberg F (moisture) values, persistent seed banks, and lateral vegetative spread. Relatively short (c. 6 years) periods of drainage and plowing impact heavily upon seed bank diversity and soils, resulting in a lack of predrainage vegetation, even after decades of subsequent restoration adjacent to intact, species-rich habitat. However, the seed banks of highly degraded fields can contribute toward the creation of novel wetland vegetation assemblages over time and under suitable environmental conditions.

J	Suter, M; Luscher, A				Suter, Matthias; Luescher, Andreas			Rapid and High Seed Germination and Large Soil Seed Bank of Senecio aquaticus in Managed Grassland	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL												Senecio aquaticus, regionally a Red List species in Europe, has become increasingly abundant in agricultural grassland of medium to high management intensity in Switzerland, Southern Germany, and Austria in recent years, where it is a threat for animal and human health due to its toxicity. In this study, we investigated the seed ecology of S. aquaticus to help protection of the species in relic populations while improving its control when abundant in managed grassland. Germination percentages of fresh ripe seeds of S. aquaticus were on average 68% in 2008, but only 45% in 2010, indicating yearly variation. Germination was generally fast: ten days after the onset of the tests, often more than 45% of all seeds had germinated. When covered with a soil layer of 5 mm, germination was only 16% compared to 63% in full light. Seeds buried in the soil for one and two years showed a germination of 78%, significantly higher than that of fresh ripe seeds, thus suggesting a stimulating effect of cold-wet stratification on germination and long seed survival in the soil. In grasslands with established populations of S. aquaticus, the number of germinable seeds of the species ranged from 361 to 1875 m(-2) in topsoil (0-10 cm) with an average of 1139 m(-2). The large seed bank and the rapid and high germination of S. aquaticus suggest that allowing seed formation is important for its preservation in relic populations. With respect to agricultural grassland, strategies to control the species should initially target hindering seed production and dispersal.

These gaps were being used as an alternative to the regular shelterwood system to create uneven-aged stands. The effects of gap size (15 and 40 m diameter) and canopy openness on herbaceous species colonization and persistence were assessed in a systematic grid of 5 x 5 m. Overall, herbaceous cover was low before gap creation, increased soon afterwards, and continued to rise over time. The number of herb species increased in the gaps and, to a lesser extent, in adjacent areas under the remaining tree canopy. Colonization of gaps was rapid and there was substantial turnover of species i.e. various species disappeared from the gaps over time whilst others colonized. Species with both long-term persistent seed banks and long distance dispersal abilities were the most successful types colonizing gaps. Six species occurred preferentially in large gaps, while only one species was found to prefer small gaps. Species present before gap creation survived in both gap sizes. Smaller gaps with a diameter of half the height of canopy trees also tended to remain free of common weed species, whereas large cover of Rubus fruticosus L. and Calamagrostis epigejos (L.) Roth could hamper natural regeneration in larger gaps. For the successful regeneration of beech we recommend the use of small gaps complemented by few large gaps.																	0037-5330	2242-4075					2012	46	1					53	65	65	10.14214/sf.65							WOS:000303427900006

Dormancy cycling in Arabidopsis seeds is controlled by seasonally distinct hormone-signaling pathways	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Seeds respond to environmental signals, tuning their dormancy cycles to the seasons and thereby determining the optimum time for plant establishment. The molecular regulation of dormancy cycling is unknown, but an extensive range of mechanisms have been identified in laboratory experiments. Using a targeted investigation of gene expression over the dormancy cycle of Arabidopsis seeds in the field, we investigated how these mechanisms are seasonally coordinated. Depth of dormancy and gene expression patterns were correlated with seasonal changes in soil temperature. The results were consistent with abscisic acid (ABA) signaling linked to deep dormancy in winter being repressed in spring concurrent with enhanced DELLA repression of germination as depth of dormancy decreased. Dormancy increased during winter as soil temperature declined and expression of ABA synthesis (NCED6) and gibberellic acid (GA) catabolism (GA2ox2) genes increased. This was linked to an increase in endogenous ABA that plateaus, but dormancy and DOG1 and MFT expression continued to increase. The expression of SNF1-related protein kinases, SnrK 2.1 and 2.4, also increased consistent with enhanced ABA signaling and sensitivity being modulated by seasonal soil temperature. Dormancy then declined in spring and summer. Endogenous ABA decreased along with positive ABA signaling as expression of ABI2, ABI4, and ABA catabolism (CYP707A2) and GA synthesis (GA3ox1) genes increased. However, during the low dormancy phase in the summer, expression of transcripts for the germination repressors RGA and RGL2 increased. Unlike deep winter dormancy, this represson can be removed on exposure to light, enabling the completion of germination at the correct time of year.

That these practices' effects on crop population genetics have not been quantified bespeaks lack of an appropriate analytical framework. We use a model that construes seed-management practices as part of a crop's demography to describe the dynamics of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) in Cauca, Colombia. We quantify several management practices for cassava-the first estimates of their kind for a vegetatively-propagated crop-describe their demographic repercussions, and compare them to those of maize, a sexually-reproduced grain crop. We discuss the implications for gene flow, the conservation of cassava diversity, and the biosafety of vegetatively-propagated crops in centers of diversity. Cassava populations are surprisingly open and dynamic: farmers exchange germplasm across localities, particularly improved varieties, and distribute it among neighbors at extremely high rates vis-a-vis maize. This implies that a large portion of cassava populations consists of non-local germplasm, often grown in mixed stands with local varieties. Gene flow from this germplasm into local seed banks and gene pools via pollen has been documented, but its extent remains uncertain. In sum, cassava's biology and vegetative propagation might facilitate pre-release confinement of genetically-modified varieties, as expected, but simultaneously contribute to their diffusion across traditional agroecosystems if released. Genetically-modified cassava is unlikely to displace landraces or compromise their diversity; but rapid diffusion of improved germplasm and subsequent incorporation into cassava landraces, seed banks or wild populations could obstruct the tracking and eradication of deleterious transgenes. Attempts to regulate traditional farming practices to reduce the risks could compromise cassava populations' adaptive potential and ultimately prove ineffectual.																	1932-6203					DEC 12	2011	6	12							e29067	10.1371/journal.pone.0029067							WOS:000298366600060	22174952

Here, we present a unique dataset collected from a site experiencing a process of secondary invasion by Fallopia japonica after having long been invaded by Gunnera tinctoria. These are among the largest herbaceous plant species in the world and among the worst invaders in Ireland. The main objectives of this study were 1) to test for differences in the soil seed bank associated with these invaders; 2) to discuss the potential role of changes in the soil seed bank associated with G. tinctoria invasions in promoting secondary invasions by F. japonica; and 3) to discuss the potential role of niche and fitness differences in determining the outcomes of competition between these species. The differences in the characteristics of the seed bank invaded by these species were evaluated by collecting samples in comparable, adjacent areas invaded by G. tinctoria and by F. japonica. Soil samples were collected at to two points in time (May and October), from three depth categories (0-5cm; 5-10cm; 10-15cm). The seedling emergence approach was used to assess the structure of the soil seed bank. Fallopia japonica showed a capacity to alter substantially the structure of invaded soil seed bank within a short period of time. Significant changes in the composition, richness and abundance of the seed bank were observed, in both the transient and the more persistent component of the seed bank. A capacity for a rapid displacement (few years only) of long-term stands of G. tinctoria suggest a higher competitive ability for F. japonica and/or an availability of empty niches not occupied by G. tinctoria. Our findings show that the formation of a persistent soil seed bank by an invasive species is not a sufficient condition for preventing its displacement by another invader. This study represents an important starting point for evaluating the long-term implications of plant invasions on invaded ecosystems and on the potential causes of secondary invasions.

Two sites were selected for the study, designated as site 'A' and 'B'. Site 'A' was thy having low water holding capacity, on the other hand, site 'B' had high water holding capacity. Vegetation was comparatively sparse at site 'A', whereas, relatively high water holding capacity and nutrient status of the soil 'B', presumably enable the population to flourish with higher densities. I. sindica exhibited Deevey type I survivorship curves at both the sites. Plants inhabiting site 'B'showed better vegetative and reproductive growth than those surviving at site 'A'. Large quantity of seeds were present in the buried seed pool. Their number decreased after the monsoon rains i.e., after the germination of seedlings. Rise in the seed bank was observed after dispersal from the existing vegetation, thus exhibiting persistent type of seed bank. I. sindica produces heavy seeds in smaller numbers. That's why the dispersal distance travelled by the seeds was less. Most of the seeds fall near the mother plant due to their heavy weight and horizontal growth of plants.				Shaukat, S.

SOIL WARMING ALTERS SEED-BANK RESPONSES ACROSS THE GEOGRAPHIC RANGE OF FRESHWATER TAXODIUM DISTICHUM (CUPRESSACEAE) SWAMPS	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the Study: Climate warming is predicted to have far-reaching effects on the distribution of species, but those effects may depend on the flexibility of regenerating species in responding to climate gradients. We conducted a study to determine whether the variation in the response of seed banks to temperature varied across the latitudinal range of Taxodium distichum swamps in North America. Methods: The soil was collected in a long-term research network and heated experimentally to three current-day spring normal soil temperatures (average maximum daily spring normal soil temperatures during May in Illinois, Arkansas, and Louisiana, USA, respectively: 22 degrees, 25 degrees, and 29 degrees C). A "normal" is the mean temperature calculated over a 30-yr interval (1971-2000). Seed-bank density and biomass responses were examined in relation to latitude and difference in the soil temperature of the experiment and the spring normal. Key Results: Using first- and second-order regression analysis, we determined that the variation in total germination density was lowest mid-range and in experimental soil temperatures similar to the spring normal. For some dominant species, the variance in germination density was higher in the northern (Cephalanthus occidentalis) or the southern part of the network (Saururus cernuus and Polygonum pensylvanicum). Overall, the variance of total biomass (root, shoot, whole plant) was higher if the experimental soil temperature was warmer than the spring normal. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the regeneration of some populations of swamp species may have more flexibility to respond to climate warming than others.

J	Fox, BJ				Fox, Barry J.			Review of small mammal trophic structure in drylands: resource availability, use, and disturbance	JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY												Early studies of trophic structure from North American deserts set up a paradigm with granivory as a general and integral phenomenon driving the assembly and structure of small mammal communities. This paradigm encouraged many comparative studies seeking support for convergent evolution. A comprehensive review of studies of dietary habits of aridland mammals provided little support for the paradigm. Subsequent research making use of ternary phase diagrams eventually showed that in small mammal communities trophic structure is strongly related to resource use. A synthesis of results across 5 continents shows a gradation in the distribution of trophic groups across regions. The percentage of species in each dietary category from regional pools shows that no one trophic group is dominant in all desert regions studied: South America has 58% herbivores; South Africa, 52% omnivores; North America, 50% granivores; Australia, 49% insectivores; and Eurasia, roughly equal proportions of granivores, herbivores, and omnivores (similar to 30% each). Seed availability shows substantial overlap across regions but with greater maxima in North America. Granivory appears to be a less important factor in aridlands subject to disturbance regimes, and this could be a result of reduced reliability of seed resources. The impact of fire upon arid environments is one factor common across the Southern Hemisphere but with a lesser effect in the Northern Hemisphere. Fire, rainfall, and particularly extreme climatic events such as El Nino can, at times, outweigh the importance of biotic factors such as competition or predation, emphasizing the importance of resource pulses associated with disturbances. The concepts of history of place and history of lineage can be important factors determining community structure, as has been well demonstrated with the impact of the extensive evolution of the granivorous Heteromyidae in North America and the radiations of marsupials in aridlands of Australia, 2 extremes of the trophic structure shown by desert small mammal communities.																	0022-2372					DEC	2011	92	6					1179	1192		10.1644/10-MAMM-S-227.1							WOS:000298490800003

Responses of plants and invertebrate assemblages to water-level fluctuation in headwater wetlands	JOURNAL OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BENTHOLOGICAL SOCIETY												Flood-pulsing is a key environmental factor that structures biotic communities in large-order river systems, but we focused our study on the effects of flood-pulsing in headwater systems. We used 10 mesocosm wetlands (10 m X 20 m) to test 2 treatments: a flood-pulse regimen in which natural flood events caused water levels to fluctuate and a static regimen in which water levels remained artificially stable. Abiotic characteristics, plants, and aquatic invertebrate communities were monitored from 2002 through 2005 in permanent pools, nonflooded banks in static wetlands, and intermittently flooded banks in flood-pulse wetlands. The flood-pulse treatment had minimal effects on environmental conditions of permanent pools, and submersed plant and aquatic invertebrate communities in permanent pools were similar in both treatments. This result suggested that resource subsidies from the floodplain to the pools were minimal. However, flood-pulsing caused observable changes to plant communities in the intermittently flooded zone (IFZ) above the permanently flooded pool. Overall plant diversity was higher in static wetlands, and % bare ground was higher in flood-pulse wetlands, results suggesting that the short, stochastic floods were a strong environmental stressor. In flood-pulse wetlands, the fluctuating water levels may have reduced the proportion of introduced, weedy, and upland plant taxa. Flood-pulse and static wetlands had distinctly different plant assemblage compositions, indicating that the abiotic stressors caused pronounced changes in the floodplain community. An indicator species analysis showed that taxa classified as obligate wetland plants were indicators in flood-pulse wetlands (e.g., Juncus canadensis, Ludwigia palustris, Dulichium arundinaceum, Eleocharis obtusa, Carex crinita, Carex lupulina, Carex vulpinoidea), but taxa classified as facultative wetland or upland plants were indicators of static wetlands (Cirsium arvense, Eupatoriadelphus maculatus, Plantago lanceolata, Bidens frondosus, Melilotus officinalis, Mentha arvensis, Daucus carota, Poa palustris). Many functional categories of plant species that were common in flood-pulse wetlands (e.g., obligate wetland plants, perennial, native and nonweedy species) are considered beneficial from a management perspective.																	0887-3593					DEC	2011	30	4					981	996		10.1899/10-099.1							WOS:000298218600009						
J	Watanabe, H				Watanabe, Hiroaki			Development of lowland weed management and weed succession in Japan	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Since the introduction of rice production in Japan, lowland areas have been managed for rice production with the purpose of better rice growth, as well as lesser weed infestation. Rice is cropped every year in lowland fields by repeated cultivation of a single crop, with high yields and without soil sickness usually being observed in upland fields. This is probably because the irrigation water supplies various nutrients for healthy rice growth and the drainage washes out and removes harmful factors. However, until recently, the wet or flooded conditions of lowland fields in the Asian monsoon region never have allowed humans to cultivate useful summer crops, except rice or some aquatic plants. Therefore, the management of lowland areas in the Asian monsoon region has been significantly different from European field management, where crop rotation has been the traditional standard practice. Paddy weeds are aquatic plants or hygrophytes that have adapted to lowland fields. Traditionally, tillage and puddling were practiced seasonally in lowland fields on a regular schedule every year. Rice cultivation technology was developed and supported by regional irrigation systems that created stable environments for typical paddy weeds to complete their life cycle. After the introduction of chemical weed control, rice fields became very severe habitats for these paddy weeds, where they could not grow and reproduce without strategies for survival under herbicide exposure. Even so, many of the traditional paddy weeds survived because of their accumulated or uneradicated seed banks, although several aquatic plants were listed as endangered or threatened species. The important weed species changed, sometimes rapidly and sometimes slowly, depending both on their reproductive system and their biological response towards field management and weed control systems. Very recently, the level of perennial weeds, herbicide-resistant weeds, and weedy rice has increased in paddy fields that are highly dependent on herbicide use. In addition, several hygrophyte species have invaded paddy fields. In order to address these issues, the improvement and application of integrated weed management methods are expected to be critical.																	1444-6162					DEC	2011	11	4					175	189		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2011.00419.x							WOS:000298329300001

Legume seeders of the Cape Floristic Region inhabit more fertile soils than congeneric resprouters-sometimes	PLANT ECOLOGY												In fire-prone ecosystems, plants for the most part persist via either soil-stored seed banks (seeders) or below-ground storage structures (resprouters). Given their greater allocation of resources above ground to growth and reproduction, seeders are likely to have a higher nutrient requirement than resprouters. This may result in discernable differences in habitat nutrition and leaf morphology. These differences are probably accentuated in Cape legumes given their poor adaptation to low-P soils. It was hypothesized that legume seeders occupy habitats with greater fertility and possess larger, less sclerophyllous leaves than resprouters. Site nutrition and leaf morphologies were compared between seeders and resprouters in the genera Otholobium and Psoralea. There were no differences in leaf morphology between seeders and resprouters. Seeders sites had a higher total [N], exchangeable [Ca] and [Mg], and CEC, but lower [Fe] than resprouters. Only within Otholobium, did seeder sites have a higher Bray II [P]. This genus-specific variation in available P is probably a consequence of greater variation in soil type and precipitation between seeders and resprouters. Conversely, niche construction may contribute to the differences in soil fertility between seeders and resprouters in Psoralea. Thus, our data showed a general tendency for seeders to inhabit more fertile sites than resprouters. Caution is required, however, in generalizing these results, as our data indicate a difference in factors affecting soil nutrient availability between legume genera. Changes in soil fertility post-fire may limit legume persistence beyond the early stages of succession.

DFTs and germination also increase in vegetation gaps. However, dry open environments with high DFTs can also increase seedling mortality, creating conflicting selection pressures for reaction to DFTs. Since this questions the general function of DFT detection, we therefore tested if interspecific differences in DFT detection are related to mortality in different soil depths. We buried seeds of ten annual plants including species pairs of increasing and decreasing germination in response to DFTs. Seeds were buried in 5, 10 and 25cm soil depth and exhumed after two different burial times. Seed viability was tested using germination in growth chambers and tetrazolium. We also measured DFTs at these depths using temperature data loggers. DFT detection was not related to differences in mortality at three burial depths. Three species showed a clear pattern of depth dependent mortality, however inconsistently related to DFT detection. Depth detection mechanisms are more species-specific than expected. Hence, interspecific differences in seed mortalities are difficult to predict by DFT detection alone and alternative soil depth sensing mechanisms should be explored in future.

Its presence affects both ecosystem resistance and resilience. A persistent seed-bank is especially important in disturbed habitats and harsh environments. In the hilly-gullied Loess Plateau region, serious soil erosion causes decreases in soil water capacity and constrains vegetation recolonization. A stable and long-term persistent soil seed-bank is necessary for natural vegetation recolonization. We used an integrated measure of the depth distribution of seeds in the soil and the seasonal dynamics of soil seed-banks to analyse the persistence of seeds in soil and to investigate the correlation of seed longevity with seed size/shape and the species' life history. The results showed a significant tendency for small seeds and seeds of annuals/biennials to persist longer in soil than large seeds and seeds of perennials. However, seed shape was not related to persistence. The main dominant species Artemisia scoparia, Lespedeza davurica, Heteropappus altaicus, Stipa bungeana, Artemisia gmelinii, and Bothriochloa ischaemun in the different successional stages in this region can form a persistent and stable soil seed-bank. The pioneer species A. scoparia is especially significant because it can form a large, long-term, persistent seed-bank. These species can play a role in the recolonization of the eroded abandoned slope lands by vegetation.																	0960-2585					DEC	2011	21	4					295	304		10.1017/S0960258511000195							WOS:000297505300005

In this study, experimental soil perturbation (deep and shallow) was performed in degenerated sandy grassland in plots with a size of 8 x 8 m, using a randomised block design. The hypothesis that soil perturbation that inverts the soil layers decreases nutrient availability, creates vegetation gaps and thereby selects for desirable species was tested through comparisons with untreated controls as well as with nearby target habitats. The deep perturbation was designed to bring CaCO(3) up to the surface, whereas the shallow perturbation tested the effect of disturbance alone. The effects of soil perturbation on soil chemistry, vegetation and beetle communities were analysed for the 2 years following the treatments. Increased pH and calcium concentration, and decreased nitrogen and phosphorus availability, showed that deep perturbation was successful in restoring the soil chemistry to levels similar to those of the target habitat. Perturbated plots were rapidly colonised by the acid tolerant grass Corynephorus canescens, but the slow colonisation of the threatened calcicole species Koeleria glauca was an indication that the vegetation could be evolving towards the target vegetation. Six red-listed beetle species associated with open, dry grasslands were found, out of which four were found only in perturbated plots, although this could not be statistically tested. In conclusion, it may take many years or even decades for the establishment of desirable flora, and seeding could therefore be a suitable method of increasing the rate of succession.

With decreased patch size but increased total borderline length the influence of the surroundings also increased. The extent of influence is especially crucial where the forest stands are adjacent to agricultural lands. We studied the vegetation (cover) and seed bank (soil samples, seedling emergence) along adjacent stands of an abandoned vineyard and edge and interior of an oak forest community (Quercetum petraeae-cerris) widespread in Central-Europe, using five transects (16 m(2) plots along each transect). We asked the following questions: (i) How do vegetation and seed bank composition differ between the vineyard and forest interior and (ii) which weeds are able to penetrate into the forest herbaceous understorey vegetation and seed banks from the vineyard? In total, 15 phanaerophytes and 147 herbs were detected. Negatively associated with canopy shading, herb cover proved the lowest in the forest inferior. Few weeds and other ruderals recorded in vineyard penetrated into the forest interior. Mean seed density decreased one order of magnitude from the vineyard to the forest interior (from 20,831 to 2,159 seed/m(2)). The seed banks of the abandoned vineyard and edge and forest interior were dominated by ruderals, but decreasing proportion of weeds was detected from the vineyard to the forest interior. Characteristic forest herbs possessed at most sparse seed banks. Our results suggest that high canopy cover mitigates the negative impact of surrounding weedy vegetation on the forest herb layer. Therefore, the effect of surroundings is detectable mostly in the seed banks. We can assume that the formation of an increased ruderal herb cover can be foreseen if canopy opens, because the local propagule sources of forest species are missing from vegetation and soil seed banks.

Measures for the control of Senecio aquaticus in managed grassland	WEED RESEARCH												Senecio aquaticus, a plant containing toxic alkaloids, has been increasing in grasslands of Central Europe. This study aimed to identify control measures for established S. aquaticus populations. A multisite field experiment tested six control measures: ploughing followed by re-sowing, harrowing followed by re-sowing, application of a selective herbicide, pulling or digging of individuals, reduction of management intensity to a level of one annual mowing and lastly an untreated control. In the short term, herbicides and mowing once a year reduced the number of individuals of S. aquaticus most efficiently by up to 88%. No clear effects were observed for the remaining measures. Three years following application, herbicides and one annual mowing still performed best, but hardly any significant reduction in S. aquaticus was achieved compared with pre-treatment conditions. Senecio aquaticus formed large seedbanks with more than 1000 germinable seeds m(-2); the seedbank contributed to the failure of control measures, because any elimination of S. aquaticus resulted in germination and replacement by new seedlings. We conclude that owing to its seedbank, the control of established populations of S. aquaticus remains a challenge, requiring control measures over several years. Any measures that hinder the formation of populations of S. aquaticus and its seedbank in agricultural grassland will be the most efficient for its control.

The potential of cutting regimes to control problem weeds and enhance species diversity in an arable field margin buffer strip	WEED RESEARCH												Buffer zones in arable land could promote biodiversity of agricultural areas. These are most often established with sown seed mixtures of grasses and herb species. We studied the impact of cutting management and the role of the seedbank on plant species diversity of a sown buffer strip. Two main hypotheses H-1 were tested in this study: (i) sward cutting and removal have positive effects on plant species diversity in a buffer zone adjacent to a cultivated field and (ii) the buffer zone soil seedbank and adjacent grassland act as a species source for the managed buffer zone. After 5 years of management, the number of species was significantly higher and the litter coverage significantly lower in plots mown yearly with cuttings removed than in mown plots with the cuttings left or an uncut control. The abundance of Elymus repens was not affected by the cutting management. To reduce E. repens probably needs cutting more frequently than once per year. Cutting management did not reduce easily-soluble phosphorus in soils. For species colonisation, adjacent grassland played a more important role than the soil seedbank. We conclude that, in this study, the reduced litter cover, together with adjacent sources of species, resulted in the gradual increase in species diversity in the species-poor buffer habitat. This study took place in a single location and similar studies in additional locations would be helpful in assessing the generality of our results. On the evidence of this study, the contract periods of agri-environmental schemes should be longer than 5 years to ensure cutting does result in positive benefits for the management of biodiversity.																	0043-1737	1365-3180				DEC	2011	51	6					641	649		10.1111/j.1365-3180.2011.00888.x							WOS:000297286000012

Sensitivity of weed emergence and dynamics to life-traits of annual spring-emerging weeds in contrasting cropping systems, using weed beet (Beta vulgaris ssp vulgaris) as an example	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE												Cropping systems contain a diverse multi-species weed flora including several species that cross-breed with and/or descend from crops, including weed beet (Beta vulgaris ssp. vulgaris). The effects of cropping systems on this weed flora are complex because of their large range of variation and their numerous interactions with climate and soil conditions. In order to study and quantify the long-term effects of cropping system components (crop succession and cultural techniques) on weed population dynamics, a biophysical process-based model called GENESYS-Beet has previously been developed for weed beet. In the present paper, the model was modified to remove the crop-weed connection and employed to identify and rank the weed life-traits as a function of their effect on weed emergence timing and density as well as on weed densities at plant, adult and seed bank stages, using a global sensitivity analysis to model parameters. A similar method has already been used with the complete GENESYS-Beet model (i.e. including the crop-weed connection) based on Monte Carlo simulations with simultaneous randomization of all life-trait parameters and run in three cropping systems differing in their risk of infestation by weed beet. Simulated weed emergence timing and density, as well as surviving plant, adult and seed bank densities, were then analysed with regression models as a function of model parameters to rank life-cycle processes and related life-traits and quantify their effects. The comparison of the present, crop-independent results to those of the previous, crop-dependent study showed that the crop-relative weed beet can be considered as a typical crop-independent spring weed as long as no traits conferring a selective advantage are inherited and in rotations where crops favouring weed emergence and reproduction are frequent. In such rotations, advice for controlling the crop-relative and the crop-independent weed is more or less identical. The rarer these favourable crops, the more important pre-emergence processes become for the crop-independent weed; management advice should thus focus more on seed bank survival and seedling emergence. For the crop-relative, post-emergence processes become dominant because of the increasing necessity for a new population founding event; management advice should mostly concern the avoidance of crop bolters. In both studies, the key parameters were more or less the same, i.e. those determining the timing and success of growth, development, seed maturation and the physiological end of seed production. Timing parameters were usually more important than success parameters, showing for instance that optimal timing of weed management operations is often more important than its exact efficacy. Comparison with previous sensitivity analyses carried out for autumn-emerging weed species showed that some of the present conclusions are probably specific to spring-emerging weed species only. For autumn-emerging species, pre-emergence traits would be more important. In the rotations with frequent favourable crops and insufficient weed control, interactions between traits were small, indicating that diverse populations and species with contrasting traits could prosper, potentially leading to a diverse multi-species weed flora. Conversely, when favourable crops were rare and weed control optimal, traits had little impact individually, indicating that a small number of optimal combinations of traits would be successful, thus limiting both intra-and inter-specific variability.

J	Casanova, MT				Casanova, Michelle T.			Using water plant functional groups to investigate environmental water requirements	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Analysis of the distribution and abundance of water plants can be a useful tool for determining the ecological water requirements of sites in a catchment. 2. Seed-bank and vegetation surveys of wetland and riparian sites were undertaken in the Angas River catchment in South Australia to determine the distribution and abundance of plants associated with riparian habitats. Plant species were allocated to water plant functional groups (WPFGs sensu Brock and Casanova, Frontiers in Ecology; Building the Links, 1997, Elsevier Science). In addition to the seven functional groups already recognised, three new groups containing submerged and woody growth forms were included in this study. 3. Cluster analysis of sites on the basis of species presence/absence was compared with site clustering obtained from analysis of representation of WPFGs. Functional group analysis provided a similar segregation of species-poor sites to that resulting from analysis of species presence/absence, but provided better resolution of clusters for species-rich sites. Three clusters of species-rich sites were delineated: riparian sites that require year-round permanent water but have fluctuating water levels, spatially and temporally variable riparian sites with shrubs and trees and temporary wetlands that dry annually. 4. Segregation of sites on the basis of functional group representation can provide information to managers about the water requirements of suites of species in different parts of the catchment. Knowledge of the environmental water requirements of sites within a catchment can help managers to prioritise water management options and delivery within that catchment.																	0046-5070	1365-2427				DEC	2011	56	12					2637	2652		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2011.02680.x							WOS:000296502000017						
J	Moulton, CA; Gough, L				Moulton, Carol Ann; Gough, Laura			Effects of Soil Nutrient Availability on the Role of Sexual Reproduction in an Alaskan Tundra Plant Community	ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH												In a warming climate, sexual reproduction may play an important role in plant community composition in arctic tundra. As temperatures increase and currently immobilized soil nutrients become available, flowering, fruiting, and germination conditions will likely improve. We examined how experimentally adding soil nutrients for 13 and 20 years affected species composition, flower and fruit production, seed dispersal, composition of the seed bank, and seedling establishment in a dry heath plant community in northern Alaska. Fertilizer addition significantly shifted adult community composition by decreasing lichens and evergreen shrubs and increasing abundance of a bunchgrass, Hierochloe alpina, and dwarf birch, Betula nana. More seeds were dispersed adjacent to nutrient amended plots, particularly of B. nana, and soil seed banks differed significantly between control and fertilized soils reflecting the adult communities in the field. Few seedlings were observed in any field plots. However, seeds of H. alpina likely played a role in the community shift because this species has few, small individuals in control plots, yet is densely packed in fertilized plots. B. nana, on the other hand, appears to be increasing in relative abundance via vegetative growth of existing individuals. Therefore, although sexual reproduction leading to seedling establishment is rare currently, as nutrients become more available in a warming climate, individuals may recruit from seed more often as long as space is available.																	1523-0430					NOV	2011	43	4					612	620		10.1657/1938-4246-43.4.612							WOS:000298722400011						
J	Porto, M; Correia, O; Beja, P				Porto, Miguel; Correia, Otilia; Beja, Pedro			Long-term consequences of mechanical fuel management for the conservation of Mediterranean forest herb communities	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Mechanical clearing of understory vegetation is increasingly used in Euro-Mediterranean forests to reduce fire hazard, yet its long-term consequences for biodiversity remain poorly understood. This study analysed the influence of time since understory management and management frequency, on herbaceous species richness, cover and composition, functional richness and composition, and richness and cover within functional groups (life and growth forms, dispersal strategy, clonality, and plant height), using a chronosequence of cork oak (Quercus suber) stands spanning about 70 years. Overall species richness was virtually constant over time, but the richness of species with annual life form and plasticity in height was much higher in recently and recurrently treated stands; the opposite was found for perennial (mainly hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes), tussock-forming and clonal species richness, and functional richness. Overall herbaceous cover and that of annual, semi-basal, non-clonal and plastic species (in height) were favoured by recent and recurrent fuel treatments; cover by perennial (hemicryptophytes and chamaephytes), short basal, tussock-forming, and clonal species tended to increase for >10-20 years after management, and declined with management frequency. There was a marked shift in species and functional composition associated with time since understory management and management frequency. These findings suggest that widespread fuel management at <10 year intervals may shift understory herb communities to early-successional stages, impairing the persistence of species and functional groups recovering slowly after disturbance. Fuel management needs to balance the dual goals of fire hazard reduction and biodiversity conservation, retaining undisturbed patches in landscapes otherwise managed to reduce fuel accumulation.

J	Espelta, JM; Arnan, X; Rodrigo, A				Maria Espelta, Josep; Arnan, Xavier; Rodrigo, Anselm			Non-fire induced seed release ina weakly serotinous pine: climatic factors, maintenance costs or both?	OIKOS												The advantages of canopy seed retention (serotiny) for plants inhabiting fire-prone ecosystems are well documented. However, very few species are completely serotinous and non-fire induced opening of serotinous fruits is commonly observed (weak serotiny). Two non-mutually exclusive causes are envisaged to contribute to this process: mechanical changes in serotinous fruits mediated by climatic conditions (e. g. drought) or the costs of maintenance for the plant of these long-lasting structures. However, their relative contribution to the spontaneous opening of serotinous fruits remains elusive as well as the consequences for the build-up of the canopy seed bank and inter-individual differences in serotiny. In this study we monitored the dynamics of cone production and cone opening in the weakly serotinous Pinus halepensis for five years (2004-2008), including two severe drought episodes (2005, 2006). Drought decreased the production of conelets, increased the abortion of immature cones, reduced the seed quality in the cohorts of cones produced during these years, and increased the opening of serotinous cones. During the first drought episode, a higher proportion of serotinous cones opened in those pines bearing a larger crop of younger cones. This suggests that not only passive changes induced by drought but also competition among cones for resources (e.g. water) might be involved in this process. The opening of serotinous cones in pines bearing more cones made inter-individual differences in the size of the canopy cone bank to narrow or even to reverse from 2004 to 2008. These results may help to understand the decrease in serotiny when pines grow and accumulate more cones and the large inter-individual variability in the degree of serotiny observed in P. halepensis forests. In addition, the negative effects of drought episodes for the size of the canopy cone bank and the seeds contained can be an unexplored cause of post-fire regeneration constraint.

J	Paluch, JG				Paluch, Jaroslaw G.			Ground seed density patterns under conditions of strongly overlapping seed shadows in Abies alba Mill. stands	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												In three subsequent years, seeds were collected from 66 to 75 seed traps in three Abies alba stands that differed in vertical structure and the number of potentially reproducing trees. The objective was to compare empirical patterns of seed density with a random (Poisson) model, which assumes that seed density would be the same in every location, and a binomial negative model that is appropriate for over-dispersed data. The seed density patterns were tested for spatio-temporal independence. The effect of some dispersal variables (number of mother trees and seed fall seasons, dispersal distance, fecundity rate) on seed density pattern was studied in a simple simulation experiment. Several local stand density measures (stem density, basal area, distance-weighted indices, canopy openness) were also tested for their ability to predict local seed density. The Poisson model was rejected in all the stands studied, and a much better fit achieved using the binomial negative model. The simulation study revealed that random seed distribution may occur only at considerable dispersal distances, concave seed shadows, and at very low fecundity rates. The seed density patterns identified exhibited both spatial and temporal correlation, which can probably be linked to the arrangement of mother trees and variation in their seed output. To a minor degree, this seed density pattern also correlated with local stand density.																	1612-4669					NOV	2011	130	6					1009	1022		10.1007/s10342-011-0486-4							WOS:000296063100010

Assessing the potential for biotic communities to recolonise freshwater wetlands affected by sulfidic sediments	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The formation of sulfidic sediments in response to factors such as secondary salinisation and fertiliser usage is an emerging concern for the management of many freshwater wetlands. However, fundamental knowledge regarding the influence of sulfidic sediments on the aquatic biota is still lacking. 2. This study investigated the potential for biota to recolonise wetlands affected by sulfidic sediments, by assessing zooplankton hatching and aquatic plant germination following inundation with freshwater. Sediment samples were collected from 16 wetlands in the southern Murray-Darling Basin, Australia, that ranged in condition from non-impacted to possessing a known history of sulfidic sediments and/or acidification. 3. Principal Components Analysis indicated that the wetlands separated out into five different groups based on their sediment chemistry: non-impacted, sulfidic, sulfidic and highly saline (sediment EC 46 800-209 000 mu S cm(-1)), sulfidic and potentially acidic (sediment pH 5.81-6.45 and ANC 0.07-0.31% CaCO(3)), and sulfidic and acidic (sediment pH 4.37 and ANC 0.00% CaCO(3)). 4. A viable dormant propagule bank was present in all wetlands, but the taxon richness of zooplankton and aquatic plants was significantly lower in wetlands affected by sulfidic sediments compared with those that were non-affected. 5. This suggests that zooplankton and aquatic plants will be capable of recolonising wetlands that have accumulated sulfidic sediments via their propagule banks if the appropriate remediation measures are undertaken, although the communities developing are likely to be less diverse compared with those in non-affected wetlands.

J	Franzese, J; Ghermandi, L				Franzese, J.; Ghermandi, L.			Seed longevity and fire: germination responses of an exotic perennial herb in NW Patagonian grasslands (Argentina)	PLANT BIOLOGY												Fire affects grassland composition by selectively influencing recruitment. Some exotic species can increase their abundance as a consequence of fire-stimulated seed germination, but response may depend on seed age. Rumex acetosella L. (Polygonaceae, sheep's sorrel) is a cosmopolitan herb that has invaded NW Patagonia's grasslands. This species forms persistent soil seed banks and increases after disturbances, particularly fire. We studied how fire and seed longevity influence R. acetosella germination. In 2008, we conducted laboratory experiments where we exposed different-aged seeds (up to 19 years old) to heat, smoke, charcoal, ash and control treatments. Total percentage germination and mean germination time depended on both seed age and fire treatment. Germination of younger seeds decreased with increasing temperature. There was no general pattern in germination responses of different-aged seeds to smoke, charcoal and ash. While smoke improved the germination of fresh seeds, charcoal decreased germination. Germination of untreated seeds was negatively correlated with seed age, and mean germination time increased with seed age. In most treatments, fresh seeds had lower germination than 1-5-year-old seeds, indicating an after-ripening requirement. Smoke stimulates R. acetosella germination, causing successful recruitment during post-fire conditions. Fresh seeds are particularly responsive to fire factors, possibly because they have not experienced physical degradation and are more receptive to environmental stimuli. Knowing the colonisation potential from the soil seed bank of this species during post-fire conditions will allow us to predict their impact on native communities.																	1435-8603	1438-8677				NOV	2011	13	6					865	871		10.1111/j.1438-8677.2011.00447.x							WOS:000296031800006	21973326

Earthworms are increasingly recognized as important dispersers and predators of seeds. Through direct and indirect effects they influence either positively or negatively the establishment and survival of seeds and seedlings. Seedling establishment is affected by a variety of earthworm-mediated mechanisms, such as selective seed ingestion and digestion, acceleration or deceleration of germination, and seed transport. Earthworm casts deposited on the soil surface and the entrance of earthworm burrows often contain viable seeds and constitute important regeneration niches for plant seedlings and therefore likely favour specific seed traits. However, the role of earthworms as seed dispersers, mediators of seed bank dynamics and seed predators has not been considered in concert. The overall effect of earthworms on plant communities remains little understood. Most knowledge is based on laboratory studies on temperate species and future work has to explore the biological significance of earthworm-seed interactions under more natural conditions. In this review we summarize the current knowledge on earthworm-seed interactions and discuss factors determining these interactions. We highlight that this interaction may be an underappreciated, yet major driving force for the dynamics of soil seed banks and plant communities which most likely have experienced co-evolutionary processes. Despite the experimental bias, we hypothesize that the knowledge gathered in the present review is of crucial relevance for restoration and conservation ecology. For instance, as earthworms emerge as successful and ubiquitous invaders in various ecosystems, the summarized information might serve as a basis for realistic estimations and modelling of consequences on native plant communities. We depict promising directions of future research and point to the need to consider above- and belowground interactions in order to mechanistically understand the driving forces of plant community assembly.

Plant Sci. 91: 1037-1052. Rumex acetosella L., sheep sorrel, is a perennial herb originating from Europe and southwestern Asia, now found in at least 70 countries worldwide. A common weed, it appears in grasslands, pastures, rangelands, waste areas, and along roadsides across North America. It frequently occurs as a weed in lowbush blueberry fields in Atlantic Canada, particularly in Nova Scotia. Rumex acetosella thrives on poor, acidic, and disturbed soils across a broad range of climatic conditions. A persistent seed bank and vegetative reproduction from creeping roots contribute to the ability of R. acetosella to tolerate various methods of control including certain herbicides, fire, and tillage. Tart-tasting leaves, rich in vitamin C have led to the use of R. acetosella in European and North American cultures as both a source of food and a component of herbal medicines. Excessive consumption of the leaves, which contain oxalic acid, can be poisonous to horses and sheep. In addition, R. acetosella is a possible host of the tomato spotted wilt virus, which is detrimental to a variety of vegetable crops.																	0008-4220	1918-1833				NOV	2011	91	6					1037	1052		10.4141/CJPS2011-042							WOS:000297894600009

This work has focused on germination of dinoflagellate cysts, but diatom resting stages were also observed. We record the longest known survival of dormant dinoflagellate cells. We individually isolated more than 1200 cysts of the three most abundant dinoflagellate taxa: Pentapharsodinium dalei, Lingulodinium polyedrum and Scrippsiella spp. Germination success decreased with core depth, and all successful germinations took place within the first 2 wk of incubation. Pentapharsodinium dalei had the highest germination success rate, with a maximum of up to 80% in 28-yr-old sediment, and could successfully germinate from core sediments dated to 1920 +/- 12. Scrippsiella spp. cysts with cell contents occurred down to c. 90-yr-old sediment and could germinate from down to ca. 40-yr-old sediments, with a maximum germination rate of 50-60% in recent sediments. Cysts of L. polyedrum germinated frequently down to 20 yr and rarely to c. 80 yr, with a maximum of 20-50% germination success in recent sediments. Cyst isolation under cooled conditions rather than at room temperature resulted in a significantly higher germination success in P. dalei, while no effect was observed for L. polyedrum. The time elapsed since slicing of the core affected survival of L. polyedrum cysts negatively, most likely due to the effect of oxygen. The long-term survival potential of benthic resting stages that we report here has important implications, as viable resting stages accumulated in bottom sediments can be transported back to the water column by, for example, bioturbation and human-mediated sediment dredging. Hence, the sediment may to a higher degree than previously considered play a role as seed bank. This is important in a changing climate and might have particularly severe impacts in the case of harmful species.

During the past few decades, there has been increasing recreational use of these cliffs, which has caused local environmental disturbances. Successful restoration strategies hinge on identifying critical limitations. We examined the composition of aboveground forest vegetation and density and species composition of seeds in the soil seed bank at the base of four limestone cliffs in mixed deciduous forests that are intensively disturbed by human trampling and at four undisturbed cliffs in the Jura Mountains in northwestern Switzerland. We found that long-term human trampling reduced total aboveground vegetation cover at the base of cliffs and caused a significant shift in the plant-species composition. Compared with undisturbed cliffs, total seed density was lower in disturbed cliffs. Human trampling also altered the species composition of seeds in the soil seed bank. Seeds of unintentionally introduced, stress-tolerant, and ruderal species dominated the soil seed bank at the base of disturbed cliffs. Our findings indicate that a restoration of degraded cliff bases from the existing soil seed bank would result in a substantial change of the original unique plant composition. Active seed transfer, or seed flux from adjacent undisturbed forest areas, is essential for restoration success.																	0364-152X	1432-1009				NOV	2011	48	5					1024	1032		10.1007/s00267-011-9727-z							WOS:000295676100015	21863373					
J	Naik, RK; Hegde, S; Anil, AC				Naik, Ravidas Krishna; Hegde, Sahana; Anil, Arga Chandrashekar			Dinoflagellate community structure from the stratified environment of the Bay of Bengal, with special emphasis on harmful algal bloom species	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been documented along the coasts of India and the ill effects felt by society at large. Most of these reports are from the Arabian Sea, west coast of India, whereas its counterpart, the Bay of Bengal (BOB), has remained unexplored in this context. The unique characteristic features of the BOB, such as large amount of riverine fresh water discharges, monsoonal clouds, rainfall, and weak surface winds make the area strongly stratified. In this study, 19 potentially harmful species which accounted for approximately 14% of the total identified species (134) of dinoflagellates were encountered in surface waters of the BOB during November 2003 to September 2006. The variations in species abundance could be attributed to the seasonal variations in the stratification observed in the BOB. The presence of frequently occurring HAB species in low abundance (a parts per thousand currency sign40 cell L (-aEuro parts per thousand 1)) in stratified waters of the BOB may not be a growth issue. However, they may play a significant role in the development of pelagic seed banks, which can serve as inocula for blooms if coupled with local physical processes like eddies and cyclones. The predominance of Ceratium furca and Noctiluca scintillans, frequently occurring HAB species during cyclone-prone seasons, point out their candidature for HABs.

Studying the post-fire performance of tussock grasses in Patagonia: Survival, biomass production and early competition	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Patagonia grasslands are subjected to two main disturbances, fire and grazing, but little information is available about its effects on vegetation. We studied post-fire survival and resprouting ability of two dominant grass species, Stipa speciosa and Festuca pallescens, for four years: evaluated the effect of early post-fire defoliation on both species: and tested whether competition is important in post-fire recovery in San Ramon Ranch, NW Patagonia (Argentina). To simulate grazing, a clipping treatment was applied at the beginning and end of growing seasons. Survival rates were high (>60%) and, after three years, biomass of both species in the burned area was similar to the unburned area. Competition seems to play an important role in the early post-fire recovery of both species, particularly in the case of F. pallescens that increased 87% the biomass production without competition. Fire may improve forage quality by eliminating the standing dead material, but early post-fire grazing might endanger the persistence of pallescens. We suggest requiring a resting period before livestock introduction and controlling grazing intensity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Spatial patterns of the soil seed bank and extant vegetation across the dry Minjiang River valley in southwest China	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The medium-scale spatial patterns of soil seed banks (SSBs) and extant vegetation and the roles of abiotic factors are poorly understood. We selected the dry Minjiang River valley of southwest China to investigate SSB structure and corresponding extant vegetation in a medium-scale size (200-230 km long, 3-4 km wide) at eight sites across the valley using a germination method and field surveys. We found that, there was low seed density and species number in SSB and less coverage and litter thickness for community in extant vegetation at central sites compared with transitional sites across the dry valley; Quercus spp. occurred frequently in extant vegetation at transitional sites, while Caryopteris spp., Jasminum spp., Rabdosia parvifolia. Sophora davidii, Campylotropis spp., and Bauhinia faberi var. Microphylla was present frequently at central sites: Carex spp. and Artemisia spp. occurred frequently in SSB at transitional sites, while Ajania spp., Poa spp., and Fagopyrum caudatum was present more frequently at central sites. Hierarchical cluster analysis and Kendall's correlation showed that the spatial variation of both SSB and extant vegetation had significant correlation with rainfall and air evaporation.

Intense Manila clam harvesting activity took place in the intertidal Z. japonica bed during April 2004. The Z japonica bed at the study site has been monitored since January 2003. Thus, this study provided a unique opportunity to compare the structure of the Z. japonica population before and after the clamming activity, which was conducted for approximately 1 week in April 2004. All Z japonica shoots were removed and buried in the sediment immediately after the clamming activity. However, a few shoots were found at the disturbed area in July 2004, 3 months after the clamming activity. By September 2004, 5 months after the disturbance, shoot density and biomass were almost recovered to the levels reported before the clamming activity. No Z. japonica seedlings were observed when the shoot density rapidly increased in August and September 2004, 4-5 months after the disturbance, because revegetation of the disturbed seagrass bed has occurred before the seed germination time which is typically winter or early spring in this area. Thus, the initial rapid revegetation of the disturbed area occurred via asexual reproduction through new shoot formation from the buried below-ground tissues. The reproductive shoot density and reproductive efforts of Z. japonica were significantly higher after the disturbance relative to the levels recorded before the disturbance, and the duration of the fertile period was approximately three times longer following the clamming activity. The belowground biomass after the disturbance was also significantly higher than that before the disturbance. These results suggest that Z. japonica allocated more energy to sexual reproduction, as well as the maintenance of belowground tissues, to persist their population under unstable environmental conditions.

Spontaneous and assisted revegetation and changes in the physicochemical properties of the soils were evaluated in field plots that were amended with lime or lime + compost. Lime had no effect on plant productivity in comparison with the control, whereas the incorporation of lime + compost into the soil increased the plant cover and aboveground biomass. The application of lime + compost increased the plant productivity of Chrysanthemum coronarium (a species sensitive to the atmospheric emissions from the industrial complex), thus showing effective in situ stabilization of soil contaminants. Regression analyses suggested that the plant response was due to the increase in the soil organic matter content rather than to the increase in the soil pH. The aboveground biomass and plant cover did not differ under the spontaneous and assisted revegetation regimes. The native soil seed bank was sufficient for attainment of the proper plant cover and biomass production after the application of the soil amendments. Although the pCu(2+) in the amended soils was 4 orders of magnitude higher than in the unamended control, the shoot Cu concentration was similar among most of the combinations of plant species and amendments.

Assessment of soil seed bank from six different vegetation types in Kakamega forest, Western Kenya	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Kakamega forest, the only rainforest in Kenya, has faced extensive fragmentation and degradation over the last decades. Slow recovery of degraded areas is due to slow or no natural regeneration. An assessment was conducted to ascertain the contribution of soil seed bank in forest regeneration within six sites in Kakamega Forest. Sites investigated were the natural forest, plantation, shrubland, secondary grassland, natural glade, and burnt glade. Soil sampling was done from three stratified depths of 0 to 5, 5 to10 and 10 to 15 cm in each site. Soil seed bank was determined by seedling emergence technique and total seed counts. Laboratory experiments on seed viability were done in a germination chamber at 20 C. Soil seed banks in all the six vegetation types were mainly dominated by herbaceous species. There was a high seed density in the upper layers for all the sites except for natural forest and burnt glade. Seed viability tests revealed low seed viability for the seeds from all the sites. It was concluded that natural regeneration is slowed by low woody species which ranged from 5.7 for natural glade to 48.4% for natural forest soil seed bank, and a low seed viability that ranged between 1.3 for plantation to 33.8% for grassland. It is therefore important to consider other ways of forest restoration other than the soil seed bank.																	1684-5315					OCT 24	2011	10	65					14384	14391									WOS:000298549000019

Y.; Lainer, Hilde; Pavlidis, Pavlos; Stephan, Wolfgang			Inference of seed bank parameters in two wild tomato species using ecological and genetic data	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												Seed and egg dormancy is a prevalent life-history trait in plants and invertebrates whose storage effect buffers against environmental variability, modulates species extinction in fragmented habitats, and increases genetic variation. Experimental evidence for reliable differences in dormancy over evolutionary scales (e. g., differences in seed banks between sister species) is scarce because complex ecological experiments in the field are needed to measure them. To cope with these difficulties, we developed an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework that integrates ecological information on population census sizes in the priors of the parameters, along with a coalescent model accounting simultaneously for seed banks and spatial genetic structuring of populations. We collected SNP data at seven nuclear loci (over 300 SNPs) using a combination of three spatial sampling schemes: population, pooled, and species-wide samples. We provide evidence for the existence of a seed bank in two wild tomato species (Solanum chilense and Solanum peruvianum) found in western South America. Although accounting for uncertainties in ecological data, we infer for each species (i) the past demography and (ii) ecological parameters, such as the germination rate, migration rates, and minimum number of demes in the metapopulation. The inferred difference in germination rate between the two species may reflect divergent seed dormancy adaptations, in agreement with previous population genetic analyses and the ecology of these two sister species: Seeds spend, on average, a shorter time in the soil in the specialist species (S. chilense) than in the generalist species (S. peruvianum).

SOIL SEED BANK OF PLANT SPECIES AS A FUNCTION OF LONG-TERM SOIL MANAGEMENT AND SAMPLED DEPTH	PLANTA DANINHA												This study aimed at assessing the level of weed infestation indifferent areas that were submitted to different soil management for 16 years. Four management systems were studied: (1) agriculture only under conventional tillage system; (2) agriculture only under no-till system; (3) crop-livestock integrationcrop-livestock integration; (4) livestock only. These areas were sampled at three soil depths (0-5, 5-10 and 10-15 cm), and soil was stored in plastic pots and taken to a greenhouse, where soil moisture and weight were standardized. Soil was kept near 70% moisture field capacity, being revolved every 20 days when all seedling emerged from soil were counted, identified and collected for dry mass assessment. The soil coverage by weeds, number of weed seedlings and dry mass of the weedy community were assessed. A phytoecological analysis was conducted. Weed composition is differentdifferent among management systems after 16 years. Areas with livestock showed much smaller number of weed species in comparison to systems where only grain crops are grown. The presence of livestock affects the potential of germination of soil seed bank. Agriculture systems are similar in terms of weed composition along soil profile, while systems involving livestock show little relation in what regards such sampled depths. Conservationist models of land exploration contribute to reduce severity of weed species occurrence in the long term.

WEEDS OCCURRENCE AND IMPORTANCE UNDER DISTINCT INTERCROPPING SYSTEMS	PLANTA DANINHA												Intercropping systems involving corn are often subjected to stress caused by weeds, which usually result in 30-70 per cent yield loss when no control practice is applied. This study aimed to assess the composition of weed communities due to soil coverage, at neighboring areas submitted to distinct soil managements. The soil was collected at field and the study was conducted under a greenhouse in three steps: (1) weeds composition and importance within each treatment; (2) comparison between treatments (distinct crop and intercropping managements); (3) infestation in the area as a whole. The weed composition in the short term is influenced by the management of the area, but this shift requires some more years to be reflected at the soil seed bank. Some weed species occur in high densities and even this way they may not be the most serious weed species present in a given field. Just a few species are adapted to a given system of management in a level enough to be a troublesome weed. Areas differed in relation to weed infestation as a function of management adopted and number of years the new management was applied.

Metapopulation structure and fine-scaled genetic structuring in crop-wild hybrid weed beets	HEREDITY												This study explores the microspatial and temporal genetic variation in crop-wild hybrid weed beets that emerged from the seed bank in a cultivated field surveyed over two successive years. We demonstrate the occurrence of demes highly genetically differentiated, kin-structured, characterized by moderate effective population sizes, differing in propensity for selfing, and arising from nonrandom genetic subsets of the seed bank. Only one deme identified in the first survey year significantly contributed to the weed beets that emerged in the second year. Spatial structuring appears to be primarily due to gravity seed dispersal and limited pollen flow among weed beet demes. Within each genetic cluster identified by Bayesian assignments and multivariate analyses, F(IS) estimates and level of biparental inbreeding-revealed by progeny analyses-dropped to non-significant values. This suggests that random mating occurs at the scale of genetically distinct demes over a very short scale. Our results highlight the need to carefully depict genetic discontinuities in weed species, when attempting to describe their local genetic neighborhoods within which genetic drift and selective processes occur.

J	Wang, N; Jiao, JY; Jia, YF; Zhang, XA				Wang, Ning; Jiao, Ju-Ying; Jia, Yan-Feng; Zhang, Xiao-an			Soil seed bank composition and distribution on eroded slopes in the hill-gully Loess Plateau region (China): influence on natural vegetation colonization	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												On the Chinese Loess Plateau, serious slope and gully erosion have caused a decrease in soil water capacity and fertility, which has resulted in vegetation degradation and a reduction in agricultural productivity. Great efforts have been made to restore vegetation to control soil erosion, but the efficiency of artificial revegetation is not satisfactory. Natural revegetation is an alternative. However, while soil seed banks are an essential source for natural revegetation, their composition and distribution on eroded slopes remains unknown. In addition, whether or not seed loss during soil erosion limits vegetation colonization is also unknown. In this work, soil seed bank composition and distribution were studied in three situations. Specifically, three main microsites were selected as sampling plots: fish-scale pits, as artificial deposited micro-topography; under tussocks, as trap microsites; and open areas, as eroded areas. Soil samples were collected at depths of 0-2 cm, 2-5 cm and 5-10 cm. The soil seed bank was identified using germination experiments, and a total of 34 species were identified. The dominant species in the soil seed bank were annual/biennial herbs with an average proportion more than 90% and density reaching 19,000 seeds m(-2). The pioneer species Artemisia scoparia was especially abundant. The dominant later successional species, such as Lespedeza davurica, Artemisia giraldii, Artemisia gmelinii, Stipa bungeana and Bothriochloa ischcemum, were present in the soil at a density that ranged from 38 to 1355 seeds m(-2). Compared with the eroded open areas, the fish-scale pits retained a higher density of seeds, and the tussocks retained a larger number of species. However, there was no serious reduction of the soil seed bank in the erosion areas. The present study indicates that, on these eroded slopes, the soil seed bank is not the key factor limiting the colonization of natural vegetation.

J	Moeller, DA; Geber, MA; Tiffin, P				Moeller, David A.; Geber, Monica A.; Tiffin, Peter			Population Genetics and the Evolution of Geographic Range Limits in an Annual Plant	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Theoretical models of species' geographic range limits have identified both demographic and evolutionary mechanisms that prevent range expansion. Stable range limits have been paradoxical for evolutionary biologists because they represent locations where populations chronically fail to respond to selection. Distinguishing among the proposed causes of species' range limits requires insight into both current and historical population dynamics. The tools of molecular population genetics provide a window into the stability of range limits, historical demography, and rates of gene flow. Here we evaluate alternative range limit models using a multilocus data set based on DNA sequences and microsatellites along with field demographic data from the annual plant Clarkin xantiana ssp. xantiana. Our data suggest that central and peripheral populations have very large historical and current effective population sizes and that there is little evidence for population size changes or bottlenecks associated with colonization in peripheral populations. Whereas range limit populations appear to have been stable, central populations exhibit a signature of population expansion and have contributed asymmetrically to the genetic diversity of peripheral populations via migration. Overall, our results discount strictly demographic models of range limits and more strongly support evolutionary genetic models of range limits, where adaptation is prevented by a lack of genetic variation or maladaptive gene flow.

Buckwheat Residue Effects on Emergence and Growth of Weeds in Winter-Wheat (Triticum aestivum) Cropping Systems	WEED SCIENCE												Field and pot studies were conducted in Central New York to determine the potential weed-management benefits of a buckwheat cover crop grown before winter wheat. Specific objectives were to determine buckwheat residue effects on (1) emergence and growth of winter annual weeds; (2) wheat establishment and yield; and (3) emergence of summer annual weeds in the spring following overwinter seed burial. In a field study, buckwheat was sown at two timings (July or August), mowed, and either incorporated or left on the soil surface. Winter wheat was drilled into buckwheat residue in September and weed and crop growth were monitored. In a complementary pot study, four winter annual weeds were sown in soil removed from buckwheat and bare-soil plots at 0 or 15 d after incorporation and monitored for emergence and early growth. To assess buckwheat residue effects on spring emergence from overwintering seeds, seeds of three weed species were buried in buckwheat residue and bare-soil plots in the fall, exhumed in April, and evaluated for emergence. To investigate the mechanism for possible effects of buckwheat residue on overwintering seeds, two levels each of seed treatment (none or fungicide) and fertilization (none or 170 kg ha(-1)) were applied before burial. Buckwheat residue had no negative effect on wheat yields but suppressed emergence (22 to 72%) and growth (0 to 95%) of winter annual weeds, although effects were often small and inconsistent. Buckwheat residue had no effect on the emergence of buried weed seeds in spring. However, fungicide treatment enhanced the emergence of Powell amaranth seeds by 12.5 to 25.5% and of barnyardgrass seeds by 0 to 12%. Our results suggest that buckwheat residue can contribute to weed management in wheat cropping systems, but that further studies investigating the mechanistic basis for the inconsistent selective effects of buckwheat residue on weeds are needed before buckwheat use can be optimized.																	0043-1745					OCT-DEC	2011	59	4					567	573		10.1614/WS-D-11-00006.1							WOS:000296026400019						
J	Golodets, C; Kigel, J; Sternberg, M				Golodets, Carly; Kigel, Jaime; Sternberg, Marcelo			Plant diversity partitioning in grazed Mediterranean grassland at multiple spatial and temporal scales	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Grazing by large ungulates may affect plant species richness and diversity at multiple spatial and/or temporal scales, because grazing affects small-scale resource heterogeneity and plant interactions at the local scale, while effects at the landscape scale are related to grazing intensity and timing. 2. We used diversity partitioning to analyse long-and short-term effects of cattle grazing on plant species richness and diversity in an experimental spatial hierarchy in Mediterranean annual grassland. Short-term changes during secondary succession in grazed plots (2003-2005) at two grazing intensities (heavy and moderate) were analysed and compared with long-term protected vegetation. We applied Hill's q-diversity metrics at q = 0 (species richness) and q = 2 (reciprocal Simpson diversity) to examine the partitioning of species richness and diversity between their alpha (alpha) and beta (beta) components in the different treatments at four spatial scales: quadrats, within exclosures, within plots, within treatments. 3. At q = 0, alpha-diversity was always significantly lower, and beta-diversity significantly higher, than predicted by the randomised null model. Diversity partitioning at q = 2 showed a similar trend at the quadrat scale. At the exclosure scale, partitioning exhibited a similar trend during the first 2 years of secondary succession but did not deviate from the null model in the third year, as observed in protected vegetation in all years. 4. At q = 0, diversity decreased across all treatments in the short term. At q = 2, diversity was initially higher in grazed plots than in protected vegetation; alpha and beta components both decreased during secondary succession, to the levels observed in the protected vegetation. 5. Synthesis and applications. Lower dominance in grazed vegetation indicates that grazing affects competitive exclusion at the local, small scale and accentuates natural heterogeneity (e.g. patchiness of soil resources, presence of rocks in the landscape) at a larger scale. The results of this study emphasise the importance of grazing as a management tool for maintaining plant diversity at multiple scales. This is a major concern worldwide, as the area covered by natural ecosystems continues to dwindle, necessitating management of grasslands for multiple functions such as animal production, resource protection and wildlife enhancement.																	0021-8901					OCT	2011	48	5					1260	1268		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02031.x							WOS:000295095100022

Past and present management influences the seed bank and seed rain in a rural landscape mosaic	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Seed bank and seed rain represent dispersal in time and space. They can be important sources of diversity in the rural landscape, where fragmented habitats are linked by their histories. 2. Seed bank, seed rain and above-ground vegetation were sampled in four habitat types (abandoned semi-natural grassland (ABA), grazed former arable field (FAF), mid-field islet (MFI) and grazed semi-natural grassland (SNG)) in a rural landscape in southern Sweden, to examine whether community patterns can be distinguished at large spatial scales and whether seed bank and seed rain are best explained by current, past or intended future vegetation communities. 3. We counted 54 357 seedlings of 188 species from 1190 seed bank and 797 seed rain samples. Seed bank, seed rain and above-ground vegetation communities differed according to habitat. Several species characteristic of managed grassland vegetation were present in the seed bank, seed rain and vegetation of the other habitats. 4. The seed banks of SNGs and the seed rain of the FAFs were generally better predicted by the surrounding above-ground vegetation than were the other habitat types. The seed rain of the grazed communities was most similar to the vegetation in the FAFs, while the seed banks of the abandoned grasslands most resembled the vegetation in SNGs. 5. Gap availability and seed input could be limiting the colonisation of target species in FAFs, while remnant populations in the seed bank and the presence of grassland specialists in the above-ground vegetation indicate that abandoned grasslands and mid-field islets could be valuable sources of future diversity in the landscape after restoration. 6. Synthesis and applications. SNG communities are able to form seed banks which survive land-use change, but their seed rain does not reflect their above-ground communities. It is important that grassland plants set seed. By connecting existing grasslands with restoration targets, increased disturbance in the target habitats would allow for colonisation via the seed bank or seed rain, while decreased grazing intensity would benefit seed production in the source grasslands. Otherwise, landscape-wide propagule availability might increase with a more varied timing and intensity of management.

Post-clearing recovery of coastal dunes invaded by Acacia longifolia: is duration of invasion relevant for management success?	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Invasive plants destroy the structure and function of many ecosystems but removal is expensive, so the likelihood of success should be assessed before a major control programme commences. Trial clearings can clarify how best to design and perform broad-scale clearing programmes. Such trials need to consider the range of conditions that might affect the outcome of control operations, not least the duration of invasion before clearing commences, a parameter that has rarely been considered previously. 2. The recovery of plant communities was monitored over 6 years in a Portuguese coastal dune system after the removal of invasive Acacia longifolia plants, together with the underlying litter in half of the cleared areas but not in the remainder. Areas that had been invaded for > 20 years (long-invaded) as opposed to < 7 years (recently invaded) were compared. 3. After the removal of A. longifolia, recently invaded areas had more exotic plant species but also higher native species richness, plant cover, initial diversity and species turnover rates than long-invaded areas. Generalist native species were initially very abundant in cleared areas but progressively gave way to species more typical of dunes. Six years after clearing, many species that usually occur on dunes were still missing. Therophytes were the most abundant life form immediately after clearing, but nanophanerophytes, chamaephytes and A. longifolia increased with time. Seedlings of A. longifolia were most abundant in long-invaded areas, but litter removal along with plants promoted increased plant species richness and cover and decreased susceptibility to reinvasion. 4. Synthesis and applications. A number of variables can affect the outcome of clearing invasive plant species. For A. longifolia on Portuguese dunes, recently invaded areas should be prioritized and thick litter layers should be removed along with the invader. Even so, recovery of native flora was not complete in this study, and other management actions are needed to supplement clearing operations, for example propagation of native species or prescribed fires to deplete the invasive species seed bank. Although complete restoration of the ecosystem will almost always be impossible, it should be possible in the long term to create an ecosystem with a structure and function that resembles the original habitat.

J	Moreira, PA; Steenbock, W; Peroni, N; dos Reis, MS				Moreira, Priscila Ambrosio; Steenbock, Walter; Peroni, Nivaldo; dos Reis, Mauricio Sedrez			Genetic diversity and mating system of bracatinga (Mimosa scabrella) in a re-emergent agroforestry system in southern Brazil	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS												Bracatinga (Mimosa scabrella) is a legume tree species common in the early stages of succession in Araucaria angustifolia forests in southern Brazil. Bracatinga can form high-density mono-specific stands called bracatingais. Its traditional management for charcoal production involves maintenance of the seed bank. Our objective was to analyze the genetic diversity and structure of bracatingais to understand the mechanisms by which intraspecific diversity of M. scabrella is created and maintained in landscapes managed by family farmers in their agroforestry mosaics. We analyzed 14 bracatingais using 8 allozyme loci. We compared parental and progeny generation indices (7 loci) and described the mating system (9 loci) of two progenies. Overall diversity was high: A = 2.69, H-o = 0.257, H-e = 0.382 and similar between populations. Overall fixation (F = 0.364) was similar to the fixation index (f = 0.329). The genetic divergence among populations was low (Theta(p) = 0.052) but significant. The progenies' genetic diversity values were similar to those of the previous generation (H-e (pop11) = 0.342 vs. 0.420/H-e (pop10) = 0.432 vs. 0.400). Progenies were compatible with half-sib and full-sib crossing expectations (theta(xy) = 0.204 and 0.194). Our data showed that there is a tendency for genetic structuring caused not only by the reproductive system but also by genetic drift. It is very likely that the high genetic diversity is amplified by internal migration within each bracatingal. This study showed that current landscape management can contribute to maintaining high levels of bracatinga genetic diversity, which contributes to its regional conservation.

Rarity status assessments of bugseeds (Amaranthaceae: Corispermum) in Manitoba. Canadian Field-Naturalist 125(4): 338-352. To provide a more accurate assessment of the rarity of the plant genus Corispermum (Amaranthaceae), commonly known as bugseeds, in Manitoba, I undertook a survey of all historical populations. In total, 68 quarter sections were selected for presence/absence surveys; 37 of them contained at least one species of bugseed. Only 10 of the 20 historical populations in Manitoba were relocated. The total estimated size of known bugseed populations in Manitoba in 2010-2011 was approximately 9 820 to 13 060 individuals. American Bugseed (C. americanum (Nutt.) Nutt. var. americanum) is the most abundant and widespread of the bugseeds in Manitoba, followed by Hairy Bugseed (C. villosum Rydb.). There is only one population of Hooker's Bugseed (C. hookeri Mosyakin var. hookeri) in the province. Pallas' Bugseed (C. pallasii Steven) was not relocated and should probably be considered extirpated in Manitoba. The habitats at 61% of the localities where bugseeds were confirmed are anthropogenically disturbed, the most common habitat being roadsides with exposed bare sand. Of the localities where bugseeds were not relocated, 67% occurred in natural sandy areas, suggesting that dune stabilization is a major threat to the continuing persistence of these species.																	0008-3550					OCT-DEC	2011	125	4					338	352									WOS:000308336200005

Whereas several related studies have been conducted in Asian, American and some African tropical forests, no investigation has ever been conducted in Central African rainforests, especially in logged forests where the soil seed bank could contribute to regeneration of timber of trees species. We studied the soil seed bank characteristics in relation to the standing vegetation in three Cameroonian forest zones with different disturbance regimes. There was no significant difference between sites in terms of density of the seed bank; the average mean density was 87.6 seeds m(-2). But dissimilarities of the floristic compositions between sites were quite high. Overall, seeds came from 43 species including three commercial tree species. Whereas the seedlings emerging from soil samples mostly came from weedy and short-lived pioneer species, climax species predominated in the extant vegetation, leading to a very weak similarity between soil seed flora and the surrounding vegetation: Sorensen's index ranged from 3.5 to 7.6%. Canopy openness could significantly affect the species richness of soil seed stocks but not the seed density. These results show that the soil seed bank contribution to the resilience of mature tropical forests is low. In particular, very few timber tree species could benefit from soil seed stocks for their regeneration. Therefore, the development of enrichment techniques including use of the soil seed bank as a source of tree regeneration in such a context would be irrelevant. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Chalo			Threshold change in forest understory vegetation as a result of selective fuelwood extraction in Nairobi, Kenya	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												We examined whether heavy fuelwood collection can cause threshold change in understory forest community and evaluated how selective wood extraction might lead to delayed forest recovery in an urban forest of Nairobi, Kenya. Piecewise regression which represents strongest support for threshold change provided the best fit for the relationships between understory floristic composition (i.e. DCA axis 1) and human disturbance gradients (i.e. canopy cover, and distance from the slum), where threshold changes were detected at c.a. 350 m from the slum and c.a. 30% canopy cover. Only one tree species significantly indicated communities beyond the threshold while an aggressive invasive alien plant (LAP) Lantana camara was strongly represented. Total species diversity along the two human disturbance gradients peaked before the threshold was reached, suggesting that decline in species diversity along the prevailing disturbance gradient might be able to forecast threshold change. Tree species richness in the understory rapidly declined as the threshold was surpassed while other growth forms (i.e. shrubs, herbs and climbers) were relatively unaffected. The effect of selective tree cutting was indirectly impacting the forest understory as species richness pattern of preferred and non-preferred species paralleled that of trees and shrubs, respectively. Thickets of L camara can negatively affect indigenous flora and its establishment was favored under selective fuelwood extraction removing certain tree species while leaving the IAP untouched. Shading can readily eliminate the IAP, but weak tree regeneration beyond the threshold suggested forest recovery might be delayed for longer than expected because of the interaction between selective fuelwood use and the IAP.

Fire regimen and spread of plants naturalized in central Chile	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Setting fires is an old practice of land management in the Mediterranean region of central Chile. Fire in the region is currently of predominantly human origin and previously published material suggests that the scheduling of these activities is associated with the spread of naturalized exotic species. Research into the effects of fire on both native and exotic Mediterranean vegetation in central Chile has increased notably over recent years. The objective of our review is to highlight new knowledge in this area of research from the last 30 years and to contribute to systematization and an explicit conceptual model which takes into account the effect of a fire regimen on the spread of exotic plants and the mechanisms involved. We begin with analyses of the fire regimen which is currently observed in one Region of central Chile and a subsequent exploration of the literature to identify the attributes mainly of the germination of seeds which are sensitive to fire and which apply to the exotic species that are abundantly naturalized in central Chile. According to the studies consulted, diverse mechanisms have been described which involve the effect of fire on the spread of exotic plants in central Chile. Life-history traits, tolerance, facilitation, and positive feedback between exotic plants and fire frequency have been mechanisms reported in the literature. Finally, we propose a conceptual model which represents dispersal assisted by humans of exotic species and the spread of species naturalized by the effect of fire regimens, which helps explain the composition and structure of the matorral of central Chile in an early successional state.

Genetic Comparisons between Seed Bank and Stipa krylovii Plant Populations	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS												The soil seed bank represents the potential plant population since it is the source for population replacement. The genetic structure of a Stipa kryiovii (Roshev.) plant population and its soil seed bank was investigated in the Xilinguole Steppe of Inner Mongolia using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses. The population was sampled at two sites that were in close proximity to each other (0.5 km apart). Thirty plants and 18 seed bank samples were taken from each site to determine the genetic diversity between sites and between sources (plant or seed). The material was analyzed using 13 primers to produce 92 loci. Eighty-six were multi-loci, of which 23 loci (26.74%) of allele frequencies showed significant differences (P <= 0.05). The genetic similarity between two seed bank sites was 0.9843 while the genetic similarity between two plant sites was 0.9619. Their similarities were all greater than that between the seed bank and plant populations. An analysis of their genetic structure showed that87.86% of total variation was derived by two-loci. Genetic structures between plant and soil seed bank populations in S. krylovii were different due to the variance of mean gametic disequilibria and mean gene diversity. AMOVA results showed that the majority of variance (88.62%) occurred within sites, 12.75% was from between-groups. Further research is needed to investigate the selective function in maintaining the genetic diversity of Stipa krylovii plant populations.																	1022-7954	1608-3369				SEP	2011	47	9					1084	1090		10.1134/S1022795411080084							WOS:000297849200009

The study was conducted in the National Forest of Sao Francisco de Paula, RS, using six conglomerates (1ha), with 16 plots (20 x 20m) each, disregarding the surrounding 10m. Seed rain (SR) was sampled in 96 circular collectors (1m(2)), distributed in the center of each plot. The soil seed bank (SB) was collected, using iron templates (0.25 x 0.25 m) and 3m of each collector from CS. The seedling bank (SeB) was sampled in plots of 2 x 2m, located 4m from SR collectors, counting the number of individuals per specie, with height >= 30cm and diameter at breast height (DBH) < 1cm. Cluster analysis was performed by TWINSPAN (Two-way Indicator Species Analysis), associated with canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) for BP. The presence of the CS and BS clusters was verified by using the nonparametric test of the sum of the orders (Wilcoxon). Three groups were identified and CCA indicated the slope as the environmental variable with the greatest influence on the distribution of species and plots. The groups showed great relationship with its history of use; with the highest densities and lowest richness for the three mechanisms in the group related with the highest level of human interference. The presence of clusters indicates that the regenerative processes of the forest do not occur equally in the remaining forest; is necessary to know them to enable the planning of conservation and management strategies, appropriate to each species and the environment.

In this study, the germination patterns of P. angustifolius seeds were evaluated and the nature of the soil seed bank was determined. Using a weighted two-factor design, we analyzed the combined germination response to seed source (i.e. freshly matured seeds directly collected from trees versus seeds extracted from soil samples) and pretreatment (i.e. seed water-immersion for 48h at room temperature). Germination was delayed for four weeks (approximate to 30 days) in all cases, regardless of both factors analyzed. Moreover, nine additional days were necessary to achieve high germination values (in the case of fresh, pretreated seeds). These results overall may indicate the existence of a non-deep simple morphophysiological dormancy in P. angustifolius seeds. The water-immersion significantly enhanced seed germination, probably as a result of the hydration of recalcitrant seeds. Although germination of seeds extracted from soil samples was low, probably due to aging and pathogen effects throughout the time of burial, the study revealed the existence of a persistent soil seed bank (at least short-termed) of approximate to 42 viable seeds per m(2) in the upper 10cm of soil. Such a record is noteworthy since references to persistent soil seed banks in recalcitrant-seeded species are scarce in the literature. The population consequences derived from the formation of persistent soil seed banks in this endangered species are discussed. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59 (3): 1061-1069.

J	Bueno, A; Baruch, Z				Bueno, Andrea; Baruch, Zdravko			Soil seed bank and the effect of needle litter layer on seedling emergence in a tropical pine plantation	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												The soil seed bank is the basis for community establishment and permanence and plays a primary role in natural restoration of degraded or altered ecosystems. As part of a restoration project, this study aimed to quantify the soil seed bank and to evaluate the effect of the needle litter layer on seedling emergence. Soil samples from a pine plantation were collected at random in the field and set to germinate in a greenhouse. Half of them were covered by a 6cm layer of dead pine needles simulating field conditions. In the field, 20x20cm plots were established, half were left intact and half were cleaned from the litter needles. All four treatments had 15 replicates and seedling emergence was recorded during six months. Soil seed bank density was 1 222/m(2) from 17 morphotypes. In the field, the number of morphotypes and seedlings was only 9% and 6% respectively, of those emerged in the greenhouse, possibly clue to watering and lack of predation in the latter. In both cases, herbs and graminoids were the dominant emerging seedlings, making up to 70-90% of the total. The needle layer didn't prevent seeds from reaching the soil but strongly reduced (>50%) seedling emergence, although high variability within treatments resulted in no statistically significant differences. These results show that the needle layer hinders germination and/or emergence of seedlings from the seed bank. Its removal may be a recommended technique to accelerate natural restoration in pine plantations. Rev. Biol. Trop. 59(3): 1071-1079.

Population growth of Nassella trichotoma in grasslands in New Zealand slower today than in the past	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Nassella trichotoma established in modified tussock-grasslands in New Zealand from about 1860. Management programmes since 1946 have reduced populations to levels no longer impacting pastoral production. Optimising future management requires knowledge of the trajectory of population growth and its regulating demographic processes. To that end, four long-term field experiments were conducted. Net reproductive rate varied from 1.021 to 1.237 year(-1) and growth in plant basal diameter from 8.1 to 16.6 mm year(-1). The probability of flowering increased with basal diameter and was essentially unity above 50 mm diameter. Populations grubbed annually declined abruptly but recruitment was unaffected and extinction did not occur. Of seeds sown into disturbed and intact pastures, 0-51% produced seedlings and more arose on sunny slopes and from disturbed than intact pasture. Death rates were high; 7 years after sowing, surviving plants represented only 0-9% of the seed sown. Seeds buried 25 mm deep in the pasture litter on two occasions declined in viability at rates of 74 and 89% in the first year and first three months respectively and 26 and 0% year(-1) thereafter. Seed production plant(-1) (square root scale) increased linearly with plant basal diameter; for example, plants of 11 and 100 mm diameter are predicted to produce 0 and 11,092 spikelets (each with one seed) respectively. We estimate that a N. trichotoma population today will, in the absence of management, take 210 years to increase to 90% of its carrying capacity supporting the hypothesis that population growth in this species is slower than occurred historically. We show that the rates of some demographic processes may be much lower than in the past and suggest this is due to more competitive vegetation resulting from improved management. The size-dependence of many processes supports the need for a size-structured model to explain population growth in this weed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

J	Langridge, SM				Langridge, Suzanne M.			Limited Effects of Large-Scale Riparian Restoration on Seed Banks in Agriculture	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												I examined the effect of riparian forest restoration on plant abundance and diversity, including weed species, on agricultural lands along the Sacramento River in California (United States). Riparian forest restoration on the Sacramento River is occurring on a large-scale, with a goal of restoring approximately 80,000 ha over 160 km of the river. In multiuse habitats, such as the Sacramento River, effects of adjoining habitat types and movement of species across these habitats can have important management implications in terms of landscape-scale patterns of species distributions. Increased numbers of pest animals and weeds on agricultural lands associated with restored habitats could have negative economic impacts, and in turn affect support for restoration of natural areas. In order to determine the distribution and abundance of weeds associated with large-scale restoration, I collected seed bank soil samples on orchards between 0 and 5.6 km from adjacent restored riparian, remnant riparian, and agricultural habitats. I determined the abundance, species richness, and dispersal mode of plant species in the seed bank and analyzed these variables in terms of adjacent habitat type and age of restored habitat. I found that agricultural weed species had higher densities at the edge of restored riparian habitat and that native plants had higher densities adjacent to remnant riparian habitat. Weed seed abundance increased significantly on walnut farms adjacent to restored habitat with time since restored. I supply strong empirical evidence that large areas of natural and restored habitats do not lead to a greater penetration of weed species into agricultural areas, but rather that weed penetration is both temporally and spatially limited.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				SEP	2011	19	5					607	616		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00685.x							WOS:000295055900009

We studied pattern formation and population characteristics in three remnant and two restored populations of the biennial plant species Arabis nemorensis in the upper Rhine valley in southwestern Germany over a period of 2 years. We investigated spatial patterns of seedlings, juveniles, and adults as well as the small-scale horizontal and vertical distribution of seeds in the soil, followed the fate of individual plants and recorded structural habitat parameters such as vegetation and litter cover. Population dynamics differed between the study sites, but there was no pronounced difference between restored and remnant sites. Seedlings, juveniles, and adults as well as seeds in the seed bank showed aggregated spatial patterns on all study sites, with positive autocorrelation on a scale of 20-60 cm. Within sites, patterns remained approximately stable through time. Restored sites experienced rapid seed bank formation as a result of the restoration measures. Our results suggest that the restoration measures were not only successful in transferring the target species but also triggered rapid formation of spatially structured populations that, years after restoration, closely resembled those of remnant sites.

GENETIC CONSEQUENCES OF SEED BANKS IN THE PERENNIAL HERB ARABIDOPSIS LYRATA SUBSP PETRAEA (BRASSICACEAE)	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the Study: Seed banks may increase the effective population size (N-e) of plants as a result of elevated coalescence times for alleles residing in the populations. This has been empirically demonstrated in populations of the annual Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas comparable data for perennial species are currently lacking. We studied the contribution of seed banks to effective sizes of natural populations of the self-incompatible, perennial Arabidopsis lyrata subsp. petraea, a close relative of A. thaliana. Methods: Fourteen populations of A. lyrata collected throughout the Norwegian distribution range were analyzed using micro-satellite markers. Key Results: The genetic composition of seed-bank and aboveground cohorts was found to be highly similar, with little genetic differentiation between cohorts in most populations. However, the proportion of private alleles was higher in aboveground than in seed-bank cohorts. The presence of seed banks significantly increased total N-e, but the contribution from seed banks to overall N-e were lower than the contribution from aboveground cohorts in most populations. Estimated historical N-e values, reflecting the effective sizes of populations throughout the history of the species, were considerably higher than estimates of contemporary N-e, reflecting number of reproducing individuals within the past few generations. Conclusions: The results show that the seed bank contributes to total N-e in the perennial herb A. lyrata. However, the contribution is similar to or lower than that of the above-ground fraction of the population and markedly weaker than that previously documented in the annual A. thaliana.

Risk assessment, eradication, and biological control: global efforts to limit Australian acacia invasions	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Many Australian Acacia species have been planted around the world, some are highly valued, some are invasive, and some are both highly valued and invasive. We review global efforts to minimize the risk and limit the impact of invasions in this widely used plant group. Location Global. Methods Using information from literature sources, knowledge and experience of the authors, and the responses from a questionnaire sent to experts around the world, we reviewed: (1) a generalized life cycle of Australian acacias and how to control each life stage, (2) different management approaches and (3) what is required to help limit or prevent invasions. Results Relatively few Australian acacias have been introduced in large numbers, but all species with a long and extensive history of planting have become invasive somewhere. Australian acacias, as a group, have a high risk of becoming invasive and causing significant impacts as determined by existing assessment schemes. Moreover, in most situations, long-lived seed banks mean it is very difficult to control established infestations. Control has focused almost exclusively on widespread invaders, and eradication has rarely been attempted. Classical biological control is being used in South Africa with increasing success. Main conclusions A greater emphasis on pro-active rather than reactive management is required given the difficulties managing established invasions of Australian acacias. Adverse effects of proposed new introductions can be minimized by conducting detailed risk assessments in advance, planning for on-going monitoring and management, and ensuring resources are in place for long-term mitigation. Benign alternatives (e.g. sterile hybrids) could be developed to replace existing utilized taxa. Eradication should be set as a management goal more often to reduce the invasion debt. Introducing classical biological control agents that have a successful track-record in South Africa to other regions and identifying new agents (notably vegetative feeders) can help mitigate existing widespread invasions. Trans-boundary sharing of information will assist efforts to limit future invasions, in particular, management strategies need to be better evaluated, monitored, published and publicised so that global best-practice procedures can be developed.

U.			Reproductive biology of Australian acacias: important mediator of invasiveness?	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim Reproductive traits are important mediators of establishment and spread of introduced species, both directly and through interactions with other life-history traits and extrinsic factors. We identify features of the reproductive biology of Australian acacias associated with invasiveness. Location Global. Methods We reviewed the pollination biology, seed biology and alternative modes of reproduction of Australian acacias using primary literature, online searches and unpublished data. We used comparative analyses incorporating an Acacia phylogeny to test for associations between invasiveness and eight reproductive traits in a group of introduced and invasive (23) and non-invasive (129) species. We also explore the distribution of groups of trait 'syndromes' between invasive and non-invasive species. Results Reproductive trait data were only available for 126 of 152 introduced species in our data set, representing 23/23 invasive and 103/129 non-invasive species. These data suggest that invasives reach reproductive maturity earlier (10/13 within 2 years vs. 7/26 for non-invasives) and are more commonly able to resprout (11/21 vs. 13/54), although only time to reproductive maturity was significant when phylogenetic relationships were controlled for. Our qualitative survey of the literature suggests that invasive species in general tend to have generalist pollination systems, prolific seed production, efficient seed dispersal and the accumulation of large and persistent seed banks that often have fire-, heat- or disturbance-triggered germination cues. Conclusions Invasive species respond quicker to disturbance than non-invasive taxa. Traits found to be significant in our study require more in-depth analysis involving data for a broader array of species given how little is known of the reproductive biology of so many taxa in this species-rich genus. Sets of reproductive traits characteristic of invasive species and a general ability to reproduce effectively in new locations are widespread in Australian acacias. Unless there is substantial evidence to the contrary, care should be taken with all introductions.

Impacts of invasive Australian acacias: implications for management and restoration	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Aim The biophysical impacts of invasive Australian acacias and their effects on ecosystem services are explored and used to develop a framework for improved restoration practices. Location South Africa, Portugal and Chile. Methods A conceptual model of ecosystem responses to the increasing severity (density and duration) of invasions was developed from the literature and our knowledge of how these impacts affect options for restoration. Case studies are used to identify similarities and differences between three regions severely affected by invasions of Australian acacias: Acacia dealbata in Chile, Acacia longifolia in Portugal and Acacia saligna in South Africa. Results Australian acacias have a wide range of impacts on ecosystems that increase with time and disturbance, transform ecosystems and alter and reduce ecosystem service delivery. A shared trait is the accumulation of massive seed banks, which enables them to become dominant after disturbances. Ecosystem trajectories and recovery potential suggest that there are important thresholds in ecosystem state and resilience. When these are crossed, options for restoration are radically altered; in many cases, autogenic (self-driven and self-sustaining) recovery to a pre-invasion condition is inhibited, necessitating active intervention to restore composition and function. Main conclusions The conceptual model demonstrates the degree, nature and reversibility of ecosystem degradation and identifies key actions needed to restore ecosystems to desired states. Control and restoration operations, particularly active restoration, require substantial short- to medium-term investments, which can reduce losses of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and the costs to society in the long term. Increasing restoration effectiveness will require further research into linkages between impacts and restoration. This research should involve scientists, practitioners and managers engaged in invasive plant control and restoration programmes, together with society as both the investors in, and beneficiaries of, more effective restoration.

Spatial patterns of grasses and shrubs in an arid grassland environment	ECOSPHERE												In the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico and New Mexico, shrub invasion is a common problem, and once-abundant grassland ecosystems are being replaced by shrub-dominated habitat. The spatial arrangement of grasses and shrubs in these arid grasslands can provide better insight into community dynamics and can provide information on grass shrub interactions. To better understand the dynamics of the Chihuahuan Desert ecosystem and to provide information regarding the interactions between grasses and shrubs, we examined the spatial patterns of grasses and shrubs in remaining grass-dominated areas, interspersed with some shrubs. We developed 18, 10 x 20 m vegetation distribution plots by mapping the location of all grasses and shrubs on each and repeating the measurements three years later. Spatial patterns were then assessed for each plot using a second-order spatial statistic, Ripley's K-function, as well as any observed changes in the spatial patterns over a three-year period. We observed clumped grass distributions, indicating a lack of competition among grasses; random shrub distributions; and even grass distribution with respect to shrub locations, indicating competition between grasses and shrubs. We also observed a tendency for grass distributions to become more even over time, and grasses to become less even with respect to shrub locations over time. These changes occurred during a period of greater than average rainfall, indicating that greater water availability may lead to increased competition among grasses and decreased competition between grasses and shrubs.

J	Ma, MJ; Zhou, XH; Du, GZ				Ma, Miaojun; Zhou, Xianhui; Du, Guozhen			Soil seed bank dynamics in alpine wetland succession on the Tibetan Plateau	PLANT AND SOIL												The primary goal was to address several questions with regard to how soil seed banks change in a successional series. How does the composition of the viable seed bank change, and how does the relationship of the soil seed bank and vegetation change with succession? Can the seed bank be regarded as a potential as a source of seeds for wetland restoration? We collected soil seed bank samples and sampled the vegetation in four different successional stages and used the NMDS (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) to evaluate the relationship of species composition between the seed banks and vegetation. The difference of seed density and species richness in different habitats and soil depths also was compared. Viable seeds of half (37) the species in the early-successional stage were found in all the successional stages. Similarity between seed bank and vegetation increased with succession. Both seed density and species richness in the seed bank increased with successional age and decreased with soil depth. The majority of species from the early-successional stage produced long-lived seeds. Seed density and species richness increased with succession, mainly as a result of increasing seed production, and hypotheses predicting decreasing density of buried seeds and species richness were not confirmed. Seed banks play a minor role in contributing to the regeneration of vegetation, and managers cannot rely on soil-stored seed banks for restoration of wetlands.

Yet despite the diversity of road types, there is little research on the influence of these types on the spread of invaders. Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia), a plant producing large amounts of allergenic pollen, was selected as a species model for examining the impact of road type on the spread of invasive plants. We examined this relationship in an agricultural region of Quebec, Canada. We mapped plant distribution along different road types, and constructed a model of species presence. Common ragweed was found in almost all sampling sites located along regional (97%) and local paved (81%) roads. However, verges of unpaved local roads were rarely (13%) colonized by the plant. A model (53% of variance explained), constructed with only four variables (paved regional roads, paved local roads, recently mown road verges, forest cover), correctly predicted (success rate: 89%) the spatial distribution of common ragweed. Results support the hypothesis that attributes associated with paved roads strongly favour the spread of an opportunistic invasive plant species. Specifically, larger verges and greater disturbance associated with higher traffic volume create propitious conditions for common ragweed. To date, emphasis has been placed on controlling the plant in agricultural fields, even though roadsides are probably a much larger seed source. Strategies for controlling the weed along roads have only focused on major highways, even though the considerable populations along local roads also contribute to the production of pollen. Management prioritizations developed to control common ragweed are thus questionable.

J	Albrecht, MA; McCarthy, BC				Albrecht, Matthew A.; McCarthy, Brian C.			Variation in dormancy and germination in three co-occurring perennial forest herbs	PLANT ECOLOGY												Mesic deciduous forest herbs often disperse seed with morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) that prevents germination during unfavorable periods for seedling survival. However, for seeds of some species with MPD, seasonal separation of root and shoot emergence and variation in dormancy levels can complicate interpretation of seedling emergence timing in the field. We tested whether dormancy-break and germination requirements differed among co-occurring perennial forest herbs, Actaea racemosa, Hydrastis canadensis, and Sanguinaria canadensis, which are wild-harvested for their medicinal properties and known to have MPD. Seeds of all species exhibited a summer -> autumn -> winter requirement for seedling emergence in spring. However, species differed in seed-bank persistence due to variation in primary dormancy levels and stratification requirement of seeds. A. racemosa and H. canadensis can form short-term persistent seed bank, whereas S. canadensis can form a long-term persistent seed-bank, regardless of whether elaiosomes were removed from seeds prior to burial. A. racemosa seeds are dispersed in autumn with weak physiological dormancy, as seeds germinated to high rates at 15/6A degrees C after 8 weeks. In contrast, most seeds of the summer dispersed species, H. canadensis and S. canadensis, require summer temperatures to overcome physiological dormancy. Consequently, seedling emergence is reduced and delayed by 1 year if seeds are not sown immediately following the period of natural dispersal. Seedling emergence was much lower in the field than in controlled conditions for all species, especially in the small-seeded A. racemosa. Interspecific variation in dormancy levels and germination traits must be considered when establishing populations for conservation purposes and in understanding recruitment limitation in perennial forest herbs.																	1385-0237					SEP	2011	212	9					1465	1477		10.1007/s11258-011-9921-3							WOS:000293344100006

GEOMORPHOLOGY												Seed removal by water erosion may explain the sparse vegetation cover in systems like the Chinese Loess Plateau, which is characterized by severe soil erosion. The seeds from 16 species found on the plateau were examined in relation to the likelihood of their removal by erosion, as tested by rainfall simulation experiments. The experiments were performed over 1-m(2) plots with slopes of 10 degrees, 15 degrees, 20 degrees and 25 degrees for 60 min at intensities of 50 mm h(-1), 100 mm h(-1) and 150 mm h(-1), respectively. Seed loss occurred at simulated rainfall intensities of 100 mm h(-1) and 150 mm h(-1), with total seed loss rates of 26-33% and 59-67%, respectively. Most seeds were displaced, even at 50 mm h(-1). The degrees of seed loss and displacement varied among species. These data, in combination with data from our former research on propagule, seedling and population development in these species, indicate that the species with high seed loss rates either compensate by having a soil seed bank that produces seedlings during the growing season or reproduce by vegetative propagation; the species with no seed loss are still sparsely distributed. Seed germination and seedling survival seem to be more important than seed loss in determining establishment in these regions of the Loess Plateau. Seed translocation by water erosion, however, contributes to the observed distribution of vegetation in this geographic region. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Lack of Low Frequency Variants Masks Patterns of Non-Neutral Evolution following Domestication	PLOS ONE												Detecting artificial selection in the genome of domesticated species can not only shed light on human history but can also be beneficial to future breeding strategies. Evidence for selection has been documented in domesticated species including maize and rice, but few studies have to date detected signals of artificial selection in the Sorghum bicolor genome. Based on evidence that domesticated S. bicolor and its wild relatives show significant differences in endosperm structure and quality, we sequenced three candidate seed storage protein (kafirin) loci and three candidate starch biosynthesis loci to test whether these genes show non-neutral evolution resulting from the domestication process. We found strong evidence of non-neutral selection at the starch synthase IIa gene, while both starch branching enzyme I and the beta kafirin gene showed weaker evidence of non-neutral selection. We argue that the power to detect consistent signals of non-neutral selection in our dataset is confounded by the absence of low frequency variants at four of the six candidate genes. A future challenge in the detection of positive selection associated with domestication in sorghum is to develop models that can accommodate for skewed frequency spectrums.

Activity of abundant and rare bacteria in a coastal ocean	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA												The surface layer of the oceans and other aquatic environments contains many bacteria that range in activity, from dormant cells to those with high rates of metabolism. However, little experimental evidence exists about the activity of specific bacterial taxa, especially rare ones. Here we explore the relationship between abundance and activity by documenting changes in abundance over time and by examining the ratio of 16S rRNA to rRNA genes (rDNA) of individual bacterial taxa. The V1-V2 region of 16S rRNA and rDNA was analyzed by tag pyrosequencing in a 3-y study of surface waters off the Delaware coast. Over half of the bacterial taxa actively cycled between abundant and rare, whereas about 12% always remained rare and potentially inactive. There was a significant correlation between the relative abundance of 16S rRNA and the relative abundance of 16S rDNA for most individual taxa. However, 16S rRNA: rDNA ratios were significantly higher in about 20% of the taxa when they were rare than when abundant. Relationships between 16S rRNA and rDNA frequencies were confirmed for five taxa by quantitative PCR. Our findings suggest that though abundance follows activity in the majority of the taxa, a significant portion of the rare community is active, with growth rates that decrease as abundance increases.

J	Chen, YY; Bao, ZX; Li, ZZ				Chen, Yuan-Yuan; Bao, Zhao-Xia; Li, Zuo-Zhou			High allozymic diversity in natural populations of Mycoheterotrophic Orchid Gastrodia elata, an endangered medicinal plant in China	BIOCHEMICAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY												Gastrodia elata Blume, a mycoheterotrophic orchid native to the Far East, is an endangered medicinal plant in China. Genetic variation among 19 natural populations of G. elata was examined in central China by using allozyme polymorphism (16 loci in six enzymatic systems). The species exhibited high level of genetic diversity (P = 56.3%, A = 2.2 and H(E) = 0.221), which was mainly attributed to its perennial habit and mixed reproduction system (both sexual and asexual). Evident genetic differentiation in G. elata natural populations was suggested by F(ST) = 0.241. AMOVA analysis showed 31.3% of the total molecular variation was attributed to inter-population differentiation. Obvious genetic structure and genetic depauperation of some populations indicate forest fragmentation and over-collection have affected genetic variation of G. elata. A conservation strategy, which is conserving populations with great genetic distinction or high level of genetic variation from four management units, is recommended. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

A review of recent efforts at biological control of Caesalpinia decapetala (Roth) Alston (Fabaceae) in South Africa	AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY												A seed-feeding beetle, Sulcobruchus subsuturalis (Pic) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Bruchinae), was released in South Africa in 1999 as a biological control agent against the invasive, leguminous, scrambling shrub Caesalpinia decapetala (Roth) Alston (Fabaceae). Despite being easy to rear in the laboratory and having been released in large numbers (>350 000) and widely distributed at many field sites, the beetle remains scarce where present and has failed to persist at many of the original release sites. Although eggs are oviposited readily on loose seeds in dishes, the few eggs that were found at release sites in the field were always on seeds still attached to pods hanging on plants. High levels of predation and parasitism were recorded in the field, which may be hindering population expansion by the beetle. Clarity about the taxonomic status of S. subsuturalis, and uncertainty as to the centre of origin of the weed, have led to suspicions that C. decapetala may exist as several biotypes, and that the local variety may not be a suitable host for the form of S. subsuturalis that has been imported into South Africa. These uncertainties should be addressed, together with additional efforts to determine what is happening to the agent in the field. Other phytophagous species from different feeding-guilds need to be investigated as potential biological control agents.

(Asteraceae) in South Africa	AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY												The annual herbaceous plant, Parthenium hysterophorus L. (Asteraceae) (parthenium), has been a major weed of global significance for several decades, with wide-ranging impacts on agriculture, biodiversity conservation, and human and animal health. Despite this, in 2003, South Africa became the first African country and only the third country worldwide to implement a biological control programme against the weed. It seems that a suite of agents is needed to achieve effective biological control of parthenium under different environmental conditions and in different regions. The rust fungus, Puccinia abrupta Dietel & Holw. var. partheniicola (H.S. Jacks.) Parmelee (Pucciniales: Pucciniaceae), is already present in South Africa. Three agents have been imported and evaluated, namely the leaf rust fungus Puccinia xanthii Schwein. var. parthenii-hysterophorae Seier, H.C. Evans & A. Romero (Pucciniales: Pucciniaceae), which was released in 2010, and both the leaf-feeding beetle Zygogramma bicolorata Pallister (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae: Cassidinae) and the stem-boring weevil Listronotus setosipennis (Hustache) (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), for which permission to release is being sought. A stem-galling moth Epiblema strenuana (Walker) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), seed-feeding weevil Smicronyx lutulentus Dietz (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), and stem-boring moth Carmenta nr. ithacae (Beutenmiiller) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae) are also under consideration. Studies conducted in South Africa prior to the release of biological control agents, demonstrated an extensive, but highly variable, soil seed bank. In 2005, the South African biological control programme was extended to Ethiopia through an international cooperative programme. Parthenium has the potential to become more widespread and problematic in sub-Saharan Africa, and the implementation of biological control could assist in reducing this risk.																	1021-3589	1026-4914				AUG	2011	19	2			SI		378	392		10.4001/003.019.0224							WOS:000296416500017

Coastal Freshwater Wetland Plant Community Response to Seasonal Drought and Flooding in Northwestern Costa Rica	WETLANDS												Wetlands in tropical wet-dry climates are governed by distinct and extreme seasonal hydrologic fluctuations. In this study, we investigated the plant community response to seasonal flooding and drought in Palo Verde Marsh, Costa Rica. Climate change models for the region predict reduced rainfall and a drier wet season which would likely alter seasonal hydrologic cycles and prompt vegetation change. We quantified compositional change following disturbance emphasizing seasonal differences in plant life-form abundance across life history stages via standing vegetation, seed bank, and seedling recruitment measurements. Whereas the dry season standing vegetation was dominated by emergent species, aquatic species (floating-rooted, free-floating, and submerged life forms) were more dominant during the wet season. Seed bank and seedling recruitment measurements indicated that many species are resilient with life history traits that enable them to respond rapidly to extreme hydrologic filters. Interestingly, species richness was highest during seasonal flooding. Our results highlight the importance of early-wet season rainfall for plant regeneration and community change. Our findings also indicate that a drier future would likely have a large impact upon wetland plant communities with a decrease in species richness and an increase in the abundance of drought-tolerant emergent species.

We studied the relative locations of seeds and plants of a rare endangered herbaceous perennial, the Las Vegas bearpoppy (Arctomecon californica) in seven 1-ha sites randomly located within a 100-ha study area that was slated for development in Las Vegas, Nevada. We also measured the physical and biological attributes of the environment supporting the seeds and plants, including soil hardness, rock cover, cryptogamic crust cover, and associated vegetation. Arctomecon californica seed density was 0.651 seeds . m(-2), and seeds were found throughout the top 4 cm of soil. Seed viability among sites ranged from 26% to 79%; however, no significant changes between depths were detected. The spatial distribution of the seed bank coincided with the current A. californica adult distribution only in sites with both a high plant density and high numbers of seeds. Arctomecon californica adults occupied open areas within the gypsum environment that supported significantly less vegetative cover than the surrounding area. We observed a positive association between A. californica adults and shadscale (Atriplex confertifolia) and a negative association with 7 other plant species among sites. Sites with an indurated abiotic crust hosted higher numbers of A. californica adults than sites with softer soils. However, rock cover, cryptogamic crust cover, and soil hardness were poor explanatory factors for characterizing A. californica presence. We suggest that land managers should incorporate seed bank census into monitoring programs clue to the extreme year-to-year fluctuations in A. californica plant population densities.

J	Jonsdottir, IS				Jonsdottir, Ingibjorg Svala			Diversity of plant life histories in the Arctic	PRESLIA												It is argued in this paper that the diversity of plant life histories in the Arctic is much greater than indicated by general descriptions in the literature. Three basic types of life cycle are suggested as a fundamental trait-based framework for exploring the diversity of plant life histories in the Arctic: (i) annual, (ii) non-clonal perennial and (iii) clonal perennial. An overview of current understanding of traits of arctic plant life histories is provided within this framework. Based on the overview it is concluded that (i) there is a substantial diversity of plant life histories in the Arctic, and (ii) there is no single life-history trait that is specific for arctic plants. Furthermore, it is proposed that because arctic environments differ in many respects from other environments, unique combinations of life-history traits are selected among arctic plants. Consequently, arctic plants should express a unique spectrum of life histories. It is also recognized that there are large gaps in the knowledge on arctic plant life-history traits and that fine-tuned trait habitat relationships may be offset by historical, biogeographical or ecological factors, which may hamper analyses of life history habitat relationships. On the other hand, it may be rewarding in terms of an improved understanding of functional and evolutionary responses of arctic plants to climate and other environmental changes to identify potential life history syndromes (strategies) among them.

J	Schleicher, A; Peppler-Lisbach, C; Kleyer, M				Schleicher, Andrea; Peppler-Lisbach, Cord; Kleyer, Michael			Functional traits during succession: is plant community assembly trait-driven?	PRESLIA												Little is known about changes in the significance of environmental filtering and neutral processes during the succession of plant communities. Generally, a succession is expected to be trait-driven and a shift is predicted from high importance of seed dispersal ability in initial phases to importance of strong competitive ability in later stages. In this study, we consider a community assembly trait-driven in the case of a shift in functional traits during succession and randomly assembled in the case there is no shift in functional traits during succession. We therefore tested whether urban plant communities show trait convergence or trait divergence in relation of successional stage, water and nutrient availability. At two scales (100 x 100 cm and 10 x 10 cm), we analysed traits relevant to seed dispersal, stress tolerance and competitive ability and compared real data with null models. We subsequently used regression trees to associate convergence and divergence to plot age and stress due to low water and soil nutrient availability. Most traits were neither significantly convergent nor divergent and the variance explained by the regression trees was often lower than 20%. We found divergence in seed number instead of the expected convergence towards high seed number. In accord with expectations we found low seed terminal velocity and annual life span in early succession. Convergence in seed bank longevity occurred at intermediate plot age, and convergence in the combination of life span and lateral spread showed the relevance of competition filtering in the most fertile plots. On the other hand, competition-induced convergence in canopy height or specific leaf area was not supported by our results. We concluded that, based on the traits considered in this study, the overwhelming evidence was that community assembly during the first 40 years of succession was driven by trait-neutral mechanisms.

Effect of chemical and biological soil amendments on production and soil seed bank of annual medic (Medicago scutellata cv. Robinson)	RESEARCH ON CROPS												In order to study the effect of different fertilizing systems consisting of control (no fertilizer), chemical, biological and its combination fertilizer on forage yield and conservation of soil seed bank of annual medic (Medicago scutellata cv. Robinson), an experiment was conducted based on a complete randomized block design with three replications in two locations under dry farming conditions in Kermanshah province, Iran, in 2009. The results showed that the highest amount of cumulative biomass of 4185 kg/ha was produced in urea fertilizer+phosphorus solubilizing bacteria+mycorrhiza treatment, and the lowest amount (3183 kg/ha) was observed in nitrogen fixing bacteria+mycorrhiza treatment, respectively. The number of pods in soil seed bank was significantly influenced by different fertilizing systems. The highest number of 314.6 pods per square metre was found in nitrogen fixing bacteria+phosphorus solubilizing bacteria treatment and the lowest of 139.8 pods per square metre in control treatment, respectively. Also the highest yield of pods (1147.2 kg/ha) was obtained in nitrogen fixing bacteria+phosphorus solubilizing bacteria application, while the lowest pod yield of 446 kg/ha was found in control treatment.

Hidden effects of forest management practices: responses of a soil stored seed bank to logging and repeated prescribed fire	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Forest management practices have the potential to impact upon native vegetation. Most studies focus on the effects of management on the above-ground vegetation communities, with little attention given to the soil stored seed bank. Here we examine the soil stored seed bank of a long-term experimental site in south-eastern Australia, which has experienced timber harvesting and repeated prescribed burning over a 20-year period. At each of 213 long-term vegetation measurement plots, 3.5 kg of soil was collected and germinated in a glasshouse over a period of 2 years. Comparisons were made between the experimental treatments considering differences in species richness, abundance and community composition of the understorey seed bank. Logged sites had a higher diversity and abundance of seedlings compared with unlogged sites, which is consistent with observed changes in standing vegetation within 10 years following logging. Prescribed burning resulted in a lower diversity and abundance of seedlings, which contrasts with the increase in species diversity observed in response to frequent fire in standing vegetation. Individual taxa that declined in the seed bank in response to frequent fire were all taxa for which germination is enhanced by exposure to smoke. Contrary to expectations, these did not exhibit a corresponding decline as standing plants. While management actions above ground are having minor impacts, greater effects were seen in the soil stored seed bank.

To evaluate the effects of these three factors on population regeneration of Eremosparton songoricum, a rare and endangered legume, we investigated seed germination, seedling emergence and seedling survival in greenhouse and controlled field experiments in different sand dunes microsites. Freshly matured seeds are physically dormant, and the highest germination was only 9.3 +/- 5.8% at 25/10A degrees C. Seed germination occurred at burial depths from 0 to 10 cm, but the maximum depth from which seedlings emerged was 6 cm; from 1 to 6 cm, the deeper the burial, the lower the percentage of seedling emergence. Only 36.2% of the total soil seed banks occurred at depths of 0-6 cm. For artificially sown seeds at different dune microsites, mean seedling emergence percentage was 6.8%. Of 150 seedlings that emerged in the field investigation at the study site, only those germinating in flat sandy areas survived, and mean survival percentage was only 2.0%. Thus, the proportion of non-dormant seeds in soil seed banks that developed into seedlings and survived to the end of the growing season was only 0.2%. Minimum SWC for seed germination, seedling emergence and seedling survival was 2.0%. During monitoring of emergent seedlings in the field, low seedling recruitment was at least partly due to the rate of root extension (1.6 A +/- 0.3 cm day(-1)) into the sandy soil, which was slower than that of the downward movement of plant-available moisture (2.8 A +/- 0.6 cm day(-1)). Thus, population regeneration under natural conditions rarely occurred via sexual reproduction, owing to the limited water resources available for seedling establishment. Rational field seeding practices, including manually scarified or dry stored seeds before sowing, sowing the seeds at right time and suitable place, are suggested for ecological restoration of endangered E. songoricum populations.				huang, zhenying/C-5969-2015													0032-079X					AUG	2011	345	1-2					69	87		10.1007/s11104-011-0761-7							WOS:000292999700007						
J	Calvino-Cancela, M				Calvino-Cancela, Maria			Simplifying methods to assess site suitability for plant recruitment	PLANT ECOLOGY												Few studies link seed dispersal with its demographic consequences, or provide reliable estimates of seed dispersal effectiveness. One reason is the complexity of measuring the suitability for plant recruitment of seed arrival sites. In this study, I compare three methods that differ in the effort required to measure site suitability for seedling recruitment. All are based on the proportion of seeds that become seedlings (seedling-to-seed ratios). Method I is the most detailed and labour intensive. The fate of seeds was followed throughout the different steps of the recruitment process, from fruit removal until seedling emergence, including both seeds dispersed by different animals and undispersed seeds. Method II is based on seed addition experiments. Seeds were sowed in plots, and seedlings emerging were counted in the following two seasons. In Method III, average seed input during dispersal was measured with soil seed bank samples taken in pre- and post-dispersal periods, and seedling emergence estimated with samples of three seasons. Method II provided results similar to those of Method I, which, conversely, provides more insight in the actual processes driving recruitment. Method III, however, systematically underestimated site suitability (seedling-to-seed ratios) by about 50% as compared to the other methods in all microhabitats studied. Relative instead of absolute indices of site suitability were, however, reliable with this method. Method II and III are significantly less costly and could be good alternatives to Method I for some purposes, simplifying future studies on the demographic consequences of seed dispersal and the effectiveness of dispersers.

Landscape and land-use effects on weed flora in Mediterranean cereal fields	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Land-use intensity and landscape complexity could potentially affect weed flora of agroecosystems, by means of changes in species richness and composition. However, previous results indicate diverging patterns. This paper evaluates the relative importance of both factors on weed species richness and weed community composition within cereal fields in Catalonia (NE Spain). The percentage of arable land plus that occupied by human settlements within a circular sector of 1 km radius was used as a surrogate for landscape complexity and the amount of nitrogen inputs for land-use intensity. The seedbank, which could reflect the long-term effects of the agricultural intensification, and the emerged vegetation with and without weed control were surveyed to obtain comparable assessments of the weed flora, taking into account differences caused by weed control effectiveness. Intensive management induced changes in the emerged weed flora and caused a decline in species richness. Moreover, in the long-term (seedbank), it has also led to a certain level of weed loss. Conversely, landscape complexity had little effect on the seedbanks and emerged flora of cereal fields. Consequently, weed conservation policies in Mediterranean cereal fields should focus on farming practices and need not take account of the surrounding landscape. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Woody exotic plant invasions and fire: reciprocal impacts and consequences for native ecosystems	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Fire regimes influence and are influenced by the structure and composition of plant communities. This complex reciprocal relationship has implications for the success of plant invasions and the subsequent impact of invasive species on native biota. Although much attention has been given to the role of invasive grasses in transforming fire regimes and native plant communities, little is known about the relationship between woody invasive species and fire regime. Despite this, prescribed burning is frequently used for managing invasive woody species. In this study we review relationships between woody exotic plant invasions and fire in invaded ecosystems worldwide. Woody invaders may increase or decrease aspects of the fire regime, including fire frequency, intensity and extent. This is in contrast to grass invaders which almost uniformly increase fire frequency. Woody plant invasion can lead to escape from a grass-fire cycle, but the resulting reduction in fire frequency can sometimes lead to a cycle of rare but more intense fires. Prescribed fires may be a useful management tool for controlling woody exotic invaders in some systems, but they are rarely sufficient to eliminate an invasive species, and a dearth of controlled experiments hampers evaluation of their benefits. Nevertheless, because some woody invaders have fuel properties that differ substantially from native species, understanding and managing the impacts of woody invaders on fire regimes and on prescribed burns should become an important component of resource and biodiversity management.

Post-fire and post-quarry rehabilitation successions in Mediterranean-like ecosystems: Implications for ecological restoration	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Resilience against sudden changes in the environment is a very desirable trait in plants used for ecosystem restoration. Mediterranean-like vegetation exhibits particularly strong fire resilience. There are two main functional groups of fire-prone species among Mediterranean-like vegetation: seeders and resprouters. Our aims were to describe how the theory of succession after fire relates to rehabilitation and to use this knowledge to improve the results of rehabilitation attempts in Mediterranean-like ecosystems. Eight post-fire (PF) sites. 14 post-rehabilitated (PR) quarry sites and two woodland sites were sampled. Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) showed that PF and PR successions were quite different. Both displayed an increasing abundance of resprouters over time, but seeder density increased throughout PR succession and decreased during PF succession. Nine species were common to both successions in all studied stages. The results showed that until 15-21 years of succession, the post-rehabilitation sites had not become as resilient to fires as sites populated by indigenous vegetation due to the lack of a seeder seed bank. However, after 21 years of PR succession, the exponentially increasing seeder population may allow for seed bank formation and thus eventually improve the fire resilience of the site.

Ecosystem response to removal of exotic riparian shrubs and a transition to upland vegetation	PLANT ECOLOGY												Understanding plant community change over time is essential for managing important ecosystems such as riparian areas. This study analyzed historic vegetation using soil seed banks and the effects of riparian shrub removal treatments and channel incision on ecosystem and plant community dynamics in Canyon de Chelly National Monument, Arizona. We focused on how seeds, nutrients, and ground water influence the floristic composition of post-treatment vegetation and addressed three questions: (1) How does pre-treatment soil seed bank composition reflect post-treatment vegetation composition? (2) How does shrub removal affect post-treatment riparian vegetation composition, seed rain inputs, and ground water dynamics? and (3) Is available soil nitrogen increased near dead Russian olive plants following removal and does this influence post-treatment vegetation? We analyzed seed bank composition across the study area, analyzed differences in vegetation, ground water levels, and seed rain between control, cut-stump and whole-plant removal areas, and compared soil nitrogen and vegetation near removed Russian olive to areas lacking Russian olive. The soil seed bank contained more riparian plants, more native and fewer exotic plants than the extant vegetation. Both shrub removal methods decreased exotic plant cover, decreased tamarisk and Russian olive seed inputs, and increased native plant cover after 2 years. Neither method increased ground water levels. Soil near dead Russian olive trees indicated a short-term increase in soil nitrogen following plant removal but did not influence vegetation composition compared to areas without Russian olive. Following tamarisk and Russian olive removal, our study sites were colonized by upland plant species. Many western North American rivers have tamarisk and Russian olive on floodplains abandoned by channel incision, river regulation or both. Our results are widely applicable to sites where drying has occurred and vegetation establishment following shrub removal is likely to be by upland species.

Germination activity of smoke residues in soils following a fire	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												A simple and rapid bioassay was implemented to detect the germination activity of extracts from soils in pre/post-burn conditions. Soil samples taken from burnt, unburnt and adjacent plots at depths of 0-2,2-4,4-6 and 6-8 cm before and after burning mesic grassland in South Africa were analysed for germination activity over an eight-week period. Soil samples were extracted using dichloromethane and bioassayed using Grand Rapids lettuce (Lactuca saliva L.) achenes (seeds). The Grand Rapids lettuce seeds exhibited greater germination percentages when treated with extracts from burnt soil compared to the other plots. The magnitude of the germination activity declined with time since the burn. The Grand Rapids lettuce seeds also exhibited significantly higher germination when treated with unburnt soil extracts compared to the control (distilled water) which indicates the existence of other factors controlling germination in unbumt soil. Germination activity in the adjacent plots decreased with time. These findings indicate that the germination activity of the smoke derived from burning plant-material diffuses into the soil and its persistence declines with time. Considering that the soil seed bank contains viable seeds, at a moderate depth, and that they are initially unaffected by the heat of the fire, then smoke residues following a fire can influence the germination and recruitment of plant species that are responsive to smoke-derived compounds and are represented in the germinable soil seed bank.

A first report of water hyacinth (Eichhornia crassipes) soil seed banks in South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We investigated water hyacinth seed banks in several aquatic systems in South Africa. Fifteen sites, mainly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces, were surveyed from August to October 2009. Soil seed density varied between 0 and 2534 seeds/m(2) but did not differ significantly between the type of waterbody (impoundment vs. river) or the history of control carried out at a site. Average germination was 54.17% with very fast velocities (Vigour Index = 36.66) and maximum germination around three days. Although we demonstrated the existence of an important reservoir of seeds, results from this study indicated that a combination of factors such as water fluctuation, eutrophication and seed decomposition might have had a great influence on dispersal and persistence of seeds.

Reproductive potential and seed fate of Sclerocarya birrea subsp caffra (marula) in the low altitude savannas of South Africa	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Even though Sclerocarya birrea subsp. caffra (marula) is a well-studied, keystone tree species with high ecological, commercial and cultural value, significant gaps in our understanding of its reproductive biology exist, particularly the factors limiting fruit and seed production, seed fate and the persistence of the seed bank. Therefore, a detailed quantitative assessment of these factors was conducted at five sites in the low altitude savannas of South Africa. Sites varied with respect to fire regime, large mammals, geology and rainfall. Most sites showed male-biased secondary sex ratios and the minimum fruiting stem diameter ranged between 7.1 and 15.7 cm across sites. Sites with higher levels of disturbance (fire and large browsers) had trees producing fruit at larger minimum stem diameters than sites with lower levels of disturbance. Fruit production was highly variable between individuals, within and between sites, and from year to year. Variability in fruit production across years at one site was greater than the variability across sites in one year, indicating that drivers such as weather, insect herbivory, fire and predator numbers, which vary annually, play a greater role than more constant drivers such as mammalian herbivory, soil types or long-term rainfall. No significant relationship was found between environmental variables (rainfall and temperature) and annual fruit production, indicating a trade-off between vegetative growth and reproduction between years. Since manila fruits are large and heavy, the species relies primarily on mammalian dispersal agents such as the African elephant, which have also been shown to increase the germination rate. However, rodents also appear to play a significant role in seed dispersal. Seed predation rates tend to be highest in areas of low disturbance (no fire and no large browsers). While marula has a small persistent seed bank, recruitment appears to be reliant on the current season's fruit crop. This study provides a detailed quantitative assessment of important reproductive and seed fate vital rates for future population modelling. (C) 2011 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Early post-fire plant succession in Peninsula Sandstone Fynbos: The first three years after disturbance	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The early post-fire plant succession in fynbos vegetation in the Mediterranean-type climate area of South Africa was studied. Relatively little has been published on this early stage of plant succession in fynbos. Annual sampling over the first three post-fire years confirmed a steady, but relatively slow increase in plant canopy cover of shrubs and graminoids (mainly Restionaceae), whereas cover of geophytes and other herbs peaked in the first year and declined significantly, thereafter. Cover of annual plants increased each year, which may relate to the persistence of a relatively open vegetation cover by the third year. The responses of reseeder and resprouter species of the Restionaceae to the post-fire environment appeared to be habitat dependent. Cover of the reseeders increased rapidly in seep areas, but their recovery was distinctly delayed in dryland areas outside the seeps. Re-establishment of the many reseeder Erica species appeared to be delayed until the second post-fire year. Seed banks of these species were possibly negatively impacted by the fire, and required dispersal of seed from unburnt areas for recruitment. In contrast to some current generalisations, species richness appeared to increase after the fire; less certainly from the first to the second year, but more certainly from the second to the third year. Therefore, this study does not support a short-term monotonic decline in species richness after fire in fynbos. (C) 2011 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Kimura, H; Tsuyuzaki, S				Kimura, Hideo; Tsuyuzaki, Shiro			Fire severity affects vegetation and seed bank in a wetland	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: How does the severity of prescribed fires affect vegetation and seed bank in a wetland? Location: A fire-prone reed swamp in northern Japan (250 ha, 40 degrees 49'N, 141 degrees 22'E, < 10 m a.s.l.). Methods: Vegetation, biomass and seed bank were monitored for the 2 yr after annual prescribed fires were discontinued. Plant communities were placed into three categories based on fire severity: high (H) - fire consumed litter completely; moderate (M) - fire removed standing litter but left wet fallen litter; and low (L) - fire incompletely removed standing litter and did not remove fallen litter. Soil samples were collected in autumn 2007 and early summer 2008, and germinable seed bank was investigated by greenhouse trials. Results: High fire severity increased diversity in the next growing season by the establishment of short herbs in the standing vegetation. The biomass of forbs and grasses was greater in H where Phragmites australis biomass was reduced. The density of seed bank was > 30 000 seeds m(-2) throughout all the treatments. Perennial plants were dominant in the vegetation, while annuals, biennials and rushes were dominant in the seed bank. Small seeds were more abundant in the soil than in the litter. Qualitative and quantitative similarities between seed bank and the vegetation were low, and tended to be higher in H. Conclusions: Fire contributed to the development of diverse standing vegetation via the positive effects on seed bank dynamics, and can be considered a tool to maintain species-rich marshes.

Dane; Cacho, Oscar; Hester, Susie; Sims-Chilton, Nikki; Brooks, Simon			Estimating and influencing the duration of weed eradication programmes	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Weed eradication efforts often must be sustained for long periods owing to the existence of persistent seed banks, among other factors. Decision makers need to consider both the amount of investment required and the period over which investment must be maintained when determining whether to commit to (or continue) an eradication programme. However, a basis for estimating eradication programme duration based on simple data has been lacking. Here, we present a stochastic dynamic model that can provide such estimates. 2. The model is based upon the rates of progression of infestations from the active to the monitoring state (i.e. no plants detected for at least 12 months), rates of reversion of infestations from monitoring to the active state and the frequency distribution of time since last detection for all infestations. Isoquants that illustrate the combinations of progression and reversion parameters corresponding to eradication within different time frames are generated. 3. The model is applied to ongoing eradication programmes targeting branched broomrape Orobanche ramosa and chromolaena Chromolaena odorata. The minimum periods in which eradication could potentially be achieved were 22 and 23 years, respectively. On the basis of programme performance until 2008, however, eradication is predicted to take considerably longer for both species (on average, 62 and 248 years, respectively). Performance of the branched broomrape programme could be best improved through reducing rates of reversion to the active state; for chromolaena, boosting rates of progression to the monitoring state is more important. 4. Synthesis and applications. Our model for estimating weed eradication programme duration, which captures critical transitions between a limited number of states, is readily applicable to any weed. A particular strength of the method lies in its minimal data requirements. These comprise estimates of maximum seed persistence and infested area, plus consistent annual records of the detection (or otherwise) of the weed in each infestation. This work provides a framework for identifying where improvements in management are needed and a basis for testing the effectiveness of alternative tactics. If adopted, our approach should help improve decision making with regard to eradication as a management strategy.

A case study in the Patagonian Monte, Argentina	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												Domestic animals potentially affect the reproductive output of plants by direct removal of aboveground plant parts but also could alter the structure and fertility of the upper soil and the integrity of biological crusts through trampling. We asked whether sheep selectivity of plant patches along grazing paths could lead to negative changes in biological crusts and soil seed banks. We randomly selected ten floristically homogeneous vegetation stands distributed across an area (1250 ha) grazed by free ranging sheep. Vegetation stands were differently selected by sheep as estimated through sheep-collaring techniques combined with remote imagery mapping. At each stand, we extracted 15 paired cylindrical soil cores from biological crusts and from neighboring soil without crusts. We evaluated the crust cover enclosed in each core and incubated the soil samples at field capacity at alternating 10-18 degrees C during 24 months. We counted the emerged seedlings and identified them by species. Sheep selectivity along grazing paths was largest at mid-distances to the watering point of the paddock. Increasing sheep selectivity was associated with the reduction of the cover of biological crusts and the size and species number of the soil seed bank of preferred perennial grasses under biological crusts. The size of the soil seed bank of annual grasses was reduced with increasing sheep selectivity under both crust and no crust soil conditions. We did not detect changes in the soil seed banks of less- and non- preferred species (shrubs and forbs) related to sheep selectivity. Our findings highlight the negative effects of sheep selectivity on biological crusts and the soil seed bank of preferred plant species and the positive relationship between biological crusts and the size of the soil seed bank of perennial grasses. Accordingly, the state of conservation of biological crusts could be useful to assess the state of the soil seed banks of perennial grasses for monitoring, conservation and planning the sustainable management of grazing lands.

J	Godefroid, S; Phartyal, SS; Koedam, N				Godefroid, Sandrine; Phartyal, Shyam S.; Koedam, Nico			Natural versus artificial cold-stratification: which one allows better estimates of soil seed banks in a forest ecosystem?	CURRENT SCIENCE												Seedling emergence techniques provide an estimate of viable seeds in the soil seed bank based on germination of seeds under favourable germination conditions. The present contribution is aimed at studying whether artificial stratification in a cold chamber is capable of revealing more viable seeds in soil samples compared with natural cold-stratification in the soil through a winter period in order to estimate density and composition of soil seed bank in temperate forest ecosystem. A total of 384 soil samples were collected in December and June from permanently marked plots in a forest ecosystem from central Belgium. December samples were artificially stratified (AS) by undergoing a cold-moist stratification, before laying them in the greenhouse. June samples were put in a greenhouse for direct germination of seeds which were naturally stratified (NS). Emerging seedlings were identified and counted during 12 months. A total of 6960 seedlings emerged in the AS samples and 14,928 seedlings in the NS samples, corresponding to 2719 and 5831 seeds/m(2) respectively. A total of 27 species emerged from the AS samples and 19 species from the NS samples. Based on our data in a forest ecosystem with temperate humid climate on loessic materials, artificial stratification allowed the emergence of a larger number of species from the soil seed bank, but natural stratification improved estimates of the seed bank density. We therefore recommend the use of both methods to optimize the estimation of both species number and density in soil seed banks.

Thus, this study aimed to obtain information about the potential of natural regeneration mechanisms (seed rain, soil seed bank, seedling bank and established natural regeneration) in a seasonal deciduous forest fragment in Santa Maria - RS state, in order to conserve and to recover these ecosystems. The study was conducted in a systematic way, having as a point of departure the demarcation of 14 sampling plots of 2000 sq m. From those plots, 70 subplots were randomly selected to evaluate the natural regeneration mechanisms. The seed rain was evaluated during one year based on the material that was monthly collected and analyzed from the collectors. To the study of the soil seed bank, soil samplings of 25cmx25cmx5cm were taken and the collected material was monitored during 7 months, observing the seed germination. The natural regeneration was evaluated in two classes: seedling bank and established natural regeneration, where individuals h >= 30 cm and DBH <= 5 cm were identified and measured. The seed rain presented medium density of 1350 seeds m(-2), in which 73 species, predominantly arboreal, were observed. In the soil seed bank, 108 species were observed, in which 74 % were herbaceous. In the seedling bank, 48 species were found and they were heliophilous and sciaphilous species, while in the established natural regeneration, 37 species were found, prevailing sciaphilous. This study concluded that the species with the greatest potential to perpetuate in the studied area were Gymnanthes concolor, Soroceae bonplandii, Eugenia rostrifolia, Trichilia claussenii, Trichilia elegans and Dasyphylum spinescens, and they are highly indicated to the enrichment of the area. The species Myrocarpus frondosus, Cupania vernalis, Nectandra megapotamica and Syagrus rommanzoffiana showed certain restriction, depending on the silvicultural treatments in the forest to assure their perpetuation in the area.

Seed ecology of Lindera melissifolia (Lauraceae) as it relates to rarity of the species	JOURNAL OF THE TORREY BOTANICAL SOCIETY												HAWKINS, T. S.

Soc. 138: 298-307. 2011.-The seed ecology of the federally endangered shrub, Lindero melissifolia was investigated to determine if this aspect of the species life history contributes to the rarity of the species. Lindero melissifolia has the capacity to form a short-lived (two growing seasons) persistent soil seed bank if fruit pulp remains on seeds following dispersal and subsequent winter flooding occurs. Seeds, both with or without pulp (i.e., mesocarp and exocarp), exhibited tolerance to submergence, but were not hydrochorous. Following 6-12 weeks cold stratification (5 degrees or 5/1 degrees C) or submersion in cold water (5/1 degrees C) for 12 weeks, >= 63% of seeds germinated when incubated in light and at temperatures of 35/20 degrees and 30/20 degrees C. When incubated in darkness, 100% of seeds germinated following 6 weeks of cold stratification. Giberrelic acid was moderately effective in breaking dormancy. Collectively, our results indicate that seeds of L. melissifolia have nondeep physiological dormancy. Aspects of the seed ecology of L. melissifolia that may contribute to continued rarity of the species include absence of a long-term persistent soil seed bank, no obvious mechanism of long-distance dispersal, and late season germination that prevents seedling growth to a sufficient size for survival prior to cold temperatures and flooding.																	1095-5674					JUL-SEP	2011	138	3					298	307		10.3159/TORREY-D-11-00021.1							WOS:000296482600005

QUANTIFYING SEED PRODUCTION BY VOLUNTEER CANOLA (Brassica napus) AND Sinapis arvensis	PLANTA DANINHA												Volunteer canola (Brassica napus) and Sinapis arvensis are well identified weeds of different cropping systems. Quantitative information on regarding seed production by them is limited. Such information is necessary to model dynamics of soil seed banks. The aim of this work was to quantify seed production as a function of the size of those weeds. A wide range of plant size was produced by using a fan seeding system performed at two sowing dates (environments). Plant size varied from 3 to 167 g per plant for canola and from 6 to 104 g per plant for S. arvensis. Seed production ranged from 543 to 14,773 seeds per plant for canola, and from 264 to 10,336 seeds per plant for S. arvensis. There was a close relationship between seed production per plant and plant size which was well-described by a power function (y = 130.6x(0.94); R(2) = 0.93 for canola and y = 28x(1.27); R(2) = 0.95 for S. arvensis). There was also strong relationships among the number of pods produced in individual plants and the quantity of seeds produced (g per plant) with the size of the plant. The relationships found in this study can be used in dynamic seed bank models of volunteer canola and S. arvensis.

Seeds as Alternative Source of Chemical Substances with Allelopathic Activity	PLANTA DANINHA												In the literature, leaves predominate as preferred source of studies of promising allelopathic compounds, but information on other plant fractions are also found. This trend is due to the fact that most studies show that leaves have higher allelopathic potential than other plant fractions. In this review, we compiled and analyzed the information available on the importance of seeds as an alternative source of chemical compounds with allelopathic activity. We discussed the variations in production and allocation of allelochemicals at different ontogenetic stages of the seeds in the seed bank. The role played by the allelochemicals produced by the seeds on insect repellency, inhibition of the development of pathogens in seeds, initial development of competing plants and as positive signaling for the symbiosis with soil microbes were also studied. The allelopathic activity of several compounds isolated from the seeds was presented, especially alkaloids, flavonoids, resins, and benzoxazinoid glucosides. Studies of allelochemicals produced by the seeds can contribute significantly to a better understanding of the ecological role they play in the chemical ecology of agro-ecosystems and ecosystems.

Although its seeds are orthodox, they do not withstand long-term storage in conventional seed banks, motivating the development of cryopreservation for this species. Seeds within the moisture content (MC) range of 7.5% (0.08 gH(2)O.gDW(-1)) to 8.4% (0.09 gH(2)O.gDW(-1)) germinated after storage in liquid nitrogen (LN). Storage duration (15 min to 26 weeks) and rewarming regime (slow and rapid) did not significantly influence germination, which ranged between 54-67%. As no additional cryoprotective treatments were required, the protocol is time-, cost- and technically-efficient. Because transport of seeds in LN is problematic for safety, logistic and technical reasons, the feasibility of implementing germplasm transfer using T. heptaphylla seeds recovered from cryobanks was also tested. Viability was not negatively affected in seeds that had been rewarmed, recovered and maintained at room temperature for 2 weeks, allowing safe germplasm transfer in the unfrozen state. The vigor of seedlings from cryopreserved seeds, which was evaluated 90 days after transfer to soil was not influenced by LN storage compared to the controls.																	0143-2044					JUL-AUG	2011	32	4					329	338									WOS:000295308200005	22020412

The heaviest weights were obtained from cover crop consortium and their application decreased weeds incidence in such area. The seeds bank and other analyzed parameters did not show statistical differences. According to these results, it was concluded that winter cover crop could be used in crops rotation with soybean.																	1516-8913	1678-4324				JUL-AUG	2011	54	4					683	690		10.1590/S1516-89132011000400006							WOS:000294126800006

W.L. Wagner & Hoch ssp. coloradensis [syn. Gaura neomexicana Woot. ssp. coloradensis (Rydb.) Raven & Gregory]) in the Onagraceae; Primrose family) is a Threatened plant whose population declined in a protected area in southeastern Wyoming in 2007-2008, setting record low numbers in 23 years of the annual population census. This trend was accompanied by pervasive flea beetle herbivory (Altica spp.) in 2007. The most frequent flea beetle species collected in 2008-2009 was Attica foliaceae LeConte, a native species. Attica foliaceae favors members of Onagraceae, and A. foliaceae adults were collected on browsed Oenothera plants. The Oenothera population returned to pre-infestation numbers in 2009-2010, evidence that it survived by vegetative plants and seed bank. Results point to the importance of repeated long-term monitoring, without which this event could have been interpreted as a disaster or have gone unnoticed. It also documents an event that can inform population viability analysis.																	0885-8608					JUL	2011	31	3					283	287		10.3375/043.031.0310							WOS:000293309100008

CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE												Cavers, P. B., Qaderi, M. M., Threadgill, P. F. and Steel, M. G. 2011. The Biology of Canadian Weeds. 147. Onopordum acanthium L. Can. J. Plant Sci. 91: 739-758. In Canada, Scotch thistle, Onopordum acanthium L. (Asteraceae) is primarily a weed of well-drained natural areas and ruderal habitats such as abandoned gravel pits. It is classed as a noxious weed in Ontario and the North Okanagan region of British Columbia but is common only in southern Ontario. Native to southern Europe and southwestern Asia, it has been introduced to almost 50 countries in all continents except Antarctica. In parts of the United States it is a strongly competitive species that infests small grain fields and competes with desirable forage species in rangelands. It does have desirable attributes and has many uses including being consumed as a vegetable, used as a source of honey, yielding a burnable oil, incorporated in medications for many human ailments, providing grazing for goats, sheep and cattle and being grown as a garden ornamental. Despite its limited range in Canada, several distinct biotypes, differing in morphology, phenology and important ecological attributes, such as dormancy and longevity of cypselas (fruits) in the soil, have been described from southern Ontario. In Australia, a fertile hybrid of O. acanthium and O. illyricum is a major weed and there are concerns that these two species could be progenitors of a similar hybrid in North America.																	0008-4220					JUL	2011	91	4					739	758		10.4141/CJPS10195							WOS:000293155600014

Herbicide Rate, Glyphosate/Glufosinate Sequence and Corn/Soybean Rotation Effects on Weed Seed Banks	WEED SCIENCE												The effect of herbicide rates on weed control and crop yield is the subject of countless and ongoing research projects. Weed seed banks receive very little attention in comparison. The seed bank resulting from 3 yr (2006 to 2008) of single herbicide rates in a cropping system where glyphosate/glufosinate and corn/soybean were rotated or not was evaluated in a field located in St-Augustin-de-Desmaures, Quebec, Canada. Field plots under conventional tillage were seeded in corn every year, or corn and soybean (1 yr). These plots received the same herbicide every year or various glyphosate/glufosinate 3-yr sequences. Subplots were sprayed with a single POST application of the recommended rate of glyphosate (900 g ae ha(-1)) or glufosinate (500 g ai ha(-1)) or lower rates. Subplots received the same full (1.0X, recommended) or reduced (0.5X, 0.75X) rate every year. After crop harvest in 2008, soil cores were extracted and the weed seed bank was evaluated. Including soybean in the cropping system resulted in lower seed banks compared to those under continuous corn cropping. Including glufosinate in a glyphosate herbicide sequence increased weed seed banks due to the lower efficacy of the glufosinate rates tested at reducing the seed bank of annual grasses. Higher herbicide rates translated into lower seed banks, up to a certain rate. After 3 yr, the lowest seed bank (full glyphosate rates every year) still had 4,339 +/- 836 seeds m(-2) and was higher than the initial seed bank (2,826 +/- 724 seeds m(-2)).																	0043-1745	1550-2759				JUL-SEP	2011	59	3					398	403		10.1614/WS-D-10-00162.1							WOS:000292658300019

The importance of seasonal flow timing for riparian vegetation dynamics: a systematic review using causal criteria analysis	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Whilst it is widely recognised that a natural flow regime is important for sustaining riverine ecosystems, the relative importance of the various components of flow regime for riparian vegetation dynamics is poorly understood. We sought to determine the current extent of knowledge on the importance of seasonal flow timing for riparian plants by conducting a systematic review of the literature using causal criteria analysis. 2. Using a definition of ` riparian' that included riverine, wetland and floodplain systems, we found sufficient evidence to provide strong support for the existence of causal relations between seasonal flow timing and a number of riparian plant processes, namely rates of waterborne dispersal (hydrochory), germination and growth, as well as riparian community composition. There was insufficient evidence to infer a causal relationship between flow timing and the reproduction or survival of riparian plants. 3. Thus, we argue that seasonal flow timing is important for many of the processes that generate and sustain riparian vegetation communities. River regulation, and / or flow management aimed at restoring ecological values, should consider flow timing and its implication for riparian flora. Because of regulation, many of the rivers of south-eastern Australia have inverted seasonal flow patterns. Whilst direct evidence of the effects of this inversion on the flora of these rivers is lacking, the results of our causal analysis allow us to predict how these plant communities may have been affected. 4. However, these predictions must be treated with caution because of the reliance of some of the causal analyses on wetland studies. For riverine flora, further research is particularly needed on the effects of seasonal flow timing on hydrochory, survival and reproduction. 5. Causal criteria analysis provides a defensible and efficient means for assessing the extent of evidence for or against ecological hypotheses of this kind. In this case, systematic review of the literature provided strong evidence to support a number of causal links between seasonal flow timing and riparian vegetation dynamics, whilst also efficiently identifying knowledge gaps.

J	Brock, MA				Brock, Margaret A.			Persistence of seed banks in Australian temporary wetlands	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. The ability of seeds to survive periods of drying and wetting that do not lead to seed production will determine the potential species pool for future plant communities of temporary wetlands. I investigated characteristics of the seed banks in sediment from Australian temporary wetlands that might contribute to the ability of aquatic plants to re-establish after extended drought. 2. Experimental investigation into germination from sediment from six sites in five Australian temporary wetlands, with various water regimes, examined two sources of seed bank depletion: (i) length of time dry (longevity up to 12 years) and (ii) successive annual wetting and germination events (up to seven) with intervening periods dry (leaving a residual seed bank), both without any opportunity for replenishment of the seed bank. 3. These wetlands had species-rich, long-lived seed banks that were not exhausted by successive germination events. After three years of dry storage, 90% of the original seed bank species germinated, after six years 75% and after 12 years 20%. After seven successive wetting and drying events without seed bank replenishment, 48% of the original species still germinated. The mean survival time dry for seed bank species, 7.4 years, was longer than the duration of recent droughts. 4. Seed bank composition varied among wetlands and over time; most species did not occur in all wetlands and many occurred in one wetland only. The germination patterns of different species, although differing in detail, tended to be consistent in that all species could survive long dry periods and several wetting and drying events. However, experimental drought significantly diminished species richness and abundance, indicating limits to seed bank persistence. 5. Data from such long-term studies of seed bank persistence should allow prediction of the species richness and composition of the germinating communities in a wetland whose water regime is intentionally or unintentionally altered. This ability to forecast may become particularly important under climate change and the need to predict future wetland conditions.																	0046-5070					JUL	2011	56	7					1312	1327		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2010.02570.x							WOS:000292407000006

Influence of Invasive Earthworms on Above and Belowground Vegetation in a Northern Hardwood Forest	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Scientists are beginning to have a firm grasp on the dramatic influence invasive earthworms can have on nutrient cycling in northern hardwood forests, yet a concrete understanding of their effects on plant communities is still needed. Towards this effort, we examined both the above and belowground plant communities, along with soil organic matter, pH, texture and light in Arnot Forest located in south central New York. Two transects were aligned parallel to previously defined gradients of earthworm density and were sampled in the spring and summer of 2008. We found plots codominated by multiple earthworm species decreased belowground seed abundance and species richness. Aboveground plant cover and diversity along with soil organic matter was lower along the transect with multiple earthworm species. In addition, we found earthworm density increased with soil pH, but did not detect relationships with soil texture or light intensity. Our results were consistent with previous findings of earthworms negatively affecting aboveground plant communities and soil organic matter, and increasing pH. Our study demonstrates the potential for exotic earthworms to dramatically alter forest soil seed banks; however, future research is needed to investigate complexities of earthworm community dynamics (e.g., number and life form of earthworm species) and to tease apart mechanisms responsible for changes in the belowground plant community.

Effects of Alien Plants on Ecosystem Structure and Functioning and Implications for Restoration: Insights from Three Degraded Sites in South African Fynbos	ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT												We investigated the type and extent of degradation at three sites on the Agulhas Plain, South Africa: an old field dominated by the alien grass Pennisetum clandestinum Pers. (kikuyu), an abandoned Eucalyptus plantation, and a natural fynbos community invaded by nitrogen fixing-Australian Acacia species. These forms of degradation are representative of many areas in the region. By identifying the nature and degree of ecosystem degradation we aimed to determine appropriate strategies for restoration in this biodiversity hotspot. Vegetation surveys were conducted at degraded sites and carefully selected reference sites. Soil-stored propagule seed banks and macro- and micro-soil nutrients were determined. Species richness, diversity and native cover under Eucalyptus were extremely low compared to the reference site and alterations of the soil nutrients were the most severe. The cover of indigenous species under Acacia did not differ significantly from that in reference sites, but species richness was lower under Acacia and soils were considerably enriched. Native species richness was much lower in the kikuyu site, but soil nutrient status was similar to the reference site. Removal of the alien species alone may be sufficient to re-initiate ecosystem recovery at the kikuyu site, whereas active restoration is required to restore functioning ecosystems dominated by native species in the Acacia thicket and the Eucalyptus plantation. To restore native plant communities we suggest burning, mulching with sawdust and sowing of native species.

This is facilitated by a cold-induced increase in dormancy during seed maturation followed by a switch to a state during seed imbibition in which cold instead promotes germination. Here, we show that the seed maturation transcriptome in Arabidopsis thaliana is highly temperature sensitive and reveal that low temperature during seed maturation induces several genes associated with dormancy, including DELAY OF GERMINATION1 (DOG1), and influences gibberellin and abscisic acid levels in mature seeds. Mutants lacking DOG1, or with altered gibberellin or abscisic acid synthesis or signaling, in turn show reduced ability to enter the deeply dormant states in response to low seed maturation temperatures. In addition, we find that DOG1 promotes gibberellin catabolism during maturation. We show that C-REPEAT BINDING FACTORS (CBFs) are necessary for regulation of dormancy and of GA2OX6 and DOG1 expression caused by low temperatures. However, the temperature sensitivity of CBF transcription is markedly reduced in seeds and is absent in imbibed seeds. Our data demonstrate that inhibition of CBF expression is likely a critical feature allowing cold to promote rather than inhibit germination and support a model in which CBFs act in parallel to a low-temperature signaling pathway in the regulation of dormancy.

ISSRs were used to detect the genetic diversity within and among five populations representative of the species distribution range. Moderate levels of genetic diversity were revealed as percentage of polymorphic band (PPB) both at the population (PPB = 22.63%, H (S) = 0.0801, Sh = 0.1193) and species level (PPB = 48.68%, H (T) = 0.1155, Sh = 0.1837). The correlation between genetic and geographic distances was not significant (Mantel test, r = 0.17; P < 0.26).

J	Tefera, S				Tefera B, Solomon			Soil seed bank dynamics in relation to land management and soil types in the semi-arid savannas of Swaziland	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												In the semi-arid savannas of Swaziland, communal grazing, commercial ranches and game reserves are the main land management systems for animal production. These land uses can have different ecological effects on the rangelands. This study was conducted to investigate the differences in soil seed bank characteristics between three land management systems having high (communal land), low (government ranch) and medium (game reserve) stocking rates, and soil types (lithosol and vertisol or raw mineral). Two grazing areas (Bigbend and Simunye) each with the three land management systems and soil types were selected for this study. A total of 40 plant species were identified in the seed bank of both grazing areas. Panicum maximum dominated both grazing areas. Cencrhus ciliaris was dominant in Bigbend area, while Digitaria eriantha was dominant in Simunye area. Seedling density varied (P<0.05) among the land management systems and soil types. The difference in past and recent grazing pressure may be the primary cause of the observed differences. In all study sites, the soil seed bank was a poor reflection of the aboveground vegetation as revealed by weak similarity. In Bigbend, P. maximum and Urochloa mosambicensis were well represented in the seed bank. In Simunye, however, these two species were comparatively under-represented. Whereas the regeneration of the aforementioned two species from the seed bank may be high and have a profound effect in restoration of rangelands after disturbance, this may be affected by spatial differences in terms of rainfall and soil. Valuable species under-represented in the seed bank can be prone to extinction under heavy utilization and therefore, in situ conservation within certain localities should receive high priority.

J	Priest, A; Epstein, H				Priest, Anne; Epstein, Howard			Native Grass Restoration in Virginia Old Fields	CASTANEA												Over the past several centuries, upland successional grasslands of Virginia have been invaded by exotic grasses introduced from Europe. We examined three strategies (vegetation removal, nitrogen manipulation, and seeding) for improving the establishment of the native grasses Andropogon gerardii, Sorghastrum nutans, and Schizachyrium scoparium to the northern Shendandoah Valley in Virginia. Experimental plots were subjected to one of four vegetation removal techniques: plowing, glyphosate herbicide, glyphosate plus imazapic herbicide, or no removal. Each plot was divided into two subplots that were either seeded with native grass seeds or not. Within all subplots three levels of soil nitrogen were established (low, ambient, high). The result show that plots subjected to vegetation removal using both herbicides and a reduction in the plant-available soil nitrogen yielded the highest number of native grass seedlings. Native grasses were observed in all plots except for the control which had no vegetation removed. The results from this study inform grassland managers of the importance of vegetation removal prior to restoration attempts.																	0008-7475					JUN	2011	76	2					149	156		10.2179/09-056.1							WOS:000293366500003

Purple witchweed (Striga hermonthica) germination and seedbank depletion under different crops, fallow, and bare soil	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Seedbank density is an important aspect that determines the amount of damage that the parasitic weed, purple witchweed (Striga hermonthica; hereafter, called "Striga"), causes on its crop hosts. The seedbank depletion of Striga was measured in Mali and Niger during the 2004 rainy season under the host crops, pearl millet and sorghum, the non-host crops, cowpea and sesame, the intercrops of pearl millet or sorghum with cowpea or sesame, and fallow with or without weeding. Two methods were used and compared; namely, a seed bag method and a soil-sampling method. The fate of the seeds was assessed by a seed press test. Seed germination, as determined by the presence of empty seed coats, contributed most to the seedbank depletion of Striga under a variety of crop covers and fallow. The highest seedbank depletion was found under the monocultures of the host crops. The intercrops of the host and non-host crops caused less seedbank depletion, followed by the monocultures of the non-host crops, fallow, and bare soil. The seed bag method and the soil-sampling method yielded similar percentages of seedbank depletion, while the former allowed for distinguishing between the germinated and diseased seeds. The results suggest that, although all the tested crop species can cause the seed germination and seedbank depletion of Striga, management by using host cereal crops causes the highest amount of germination and has the highest potential to deplete the soil seed bank, provided that seed production is prevented.																	1444-6162					JUN	2011	11	2					100	110		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2011.00409.x							WOS:000293087300006						
J	Lopez-Toledo, L; Martinez-Ramos, M				Lopez-Toledo, Leonel; Martinez-Ramos, Miguel			The soil seed bank in abandoned tropical pastures: source of regeneration or invasion?	REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD												We assessed the availability of both pioneer and non-native species in the soil seed bank of old-growth forest and recently abandoned pasture, to evaluate whether the soil seed bank in these pastures represents a source of regeneration of species from adjacent old-growth forest or of invasion by non-native species. Our study was conducted at Selva Lacandona, Chiapas, Mexico. Soil samples were randomly collected from 6 sites in old-growth forest, and 6 sites in abandoned pastures. Seedlings from soil samples were identified and classified into pioneer, non-native (weeds/graminoids), and other forest species. Pioneer species seeds were virtually absent in pastures, but represented similar to 30% of seeds in the forest. Non-native species comprised similar to 99% of the soil seed bank in pastures. In the forest, soil seed bank density of weeds and graminoids decreased with increasing distance (up to 4 km) from agricultural fields, and comprised up to 25% (Mean +/- ISE= 16 +/- 7) of the seed bank. Our results show a near total elimination of pioneer species from the soil seed bank in pastures, and considerable invasion of the borders of the Montes Azules reserve by seeds of non-native species. Thus, in the region studied, the soil seed bank in abandoned pastures represents a source of invasion by non-native species into old-growth forest rather than a potential source of forest regeneration.

These patterns may be critical for effective plant recruitment in (semi)arid environments. Nevertheless, recruitment patterns of plant species within their range of distribution are still poorly known. Moreover, this response may be species-dependent, particularly between coexisting congenerics, which are thought to vary in demographic responses to climatic conditions as a coexistence-promoting mechanism. In this context, we investigated whether two congeneric plant species show synchronic age structures at varying spatial scales and whether they display demographic differences. Methods: We sampled 600 Helianthemum squamatum and H. syriacum individuals at six localities in Spain. We used dendro-chronological techniques to estimate age and radial growth. We compared the age structure among populations and between species and assessed the effect of site and species on different demographic parameters. Correlations between age structure and climatic factors were also determined. Key results: We detected a very low intraspecific synchrony across sites but a high interspecific coupling in age structure within localities. Secondary growth, mean age, and flowering showed large intersite differences and small interspecific differences. Summer rainfall was a good predictor of age structure. Conclusions: Fine-scale climatic variability plays a major role in determining age structure of the studied species. Climatic variability is more relevant than interspecific differences. Our results illustrate the relevance of including spatial variation in summer rainfall patterns when modeling the impact of climate change on Mediterranean plant demography.

SEED GERMINATION, SEEDLING TRAITS, AND SEED BANK OF THE TREE MORINGA PEREGRINA (MORINGACEAE) IN A HYPER-ARID ENVIRONMENT	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the study : Water-limited hot environments are good examples of hyper-aridity. Trees are scarce in these environments but some manage to survive, such as the tree Moringa peregrina. Understanding how trees maintain viable populations in extremely arid environments may provide insight into the adaptive mechanisms by which trees cope with extremely arid weather conditions. This understanding is relevant to the current increasing aridity in several regions of the world. Methods : Seed germination experiments were conducted to assess variation in seed mass, seed germination, and seedling traits of Moringa peregrina plants and the correlations among these traits. A seed burial experiment was also designed to study the fate of M. peregrina seeds buried at two depths in the soil for two time periods. Key results : On average, seeds germinated in three days and seedling shoots grew 0.7 cm per day over three weeks. Larger seeds decreased germination time and increased seedling growth rates relative to smaller seeds. Seeds remained quiescent in the soil and germination was very high at both depths and burial times. Conclusions : The after-ripening time of Moringa peregrina seeds is short and seeds germinate quickly after imbibition. Plants of M. peregrina may increase in hyper-arid environments from seeds with larger mass, shorter germination times, and faster seedling growth rates. The results also illustrate the adjustment in allocation to seed biomass and correlations among seed and seedling traits that allows M. peregrina to be successful in coping with aridity in its environment.

However there is still an anxious question why species with multiple regenerative strategies are not more frequent. In the presented work we asked whether short-lived plants with a potential bud bank i) have a wider geographical distribution, ii) occur more frequently in human-made habitats and iii) more frequently possess invasive status in comparison with the short-lived species without this additional regenerative strategy. Results show that short-lived plants with a potential bud bank are i) more widely geographically distributed, ii) under-represented in natural habitats and weakly over-represented in habitats disturbed by human activities and iii) contrary to expectation, less numerous among neophytes than species without a potential bud bank. This suggests that short-lived root-sprouters are more habitat-specialized when compared with such plants without adventitious bud-bank formation, but are more widely geographically distributed. A higher frequency of multiple regeneration strategies seems to be restricted by costs of having this ability in habitats or situations without a disturbance regime.

J	Steers, RJ; Funk, JL; Allen, EB				Steers, Robert J.; Funk, Jennifer L.; Allen, Edith B.			Can resource-use traits predict native vs. exotic plant success in carbon amended soils?	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Productivity in desert ecosystems is primarily limited by water followed by nitrogen availability. In the deserts of southern California, nitrogen additions have increased invasive annual plant abundance. Similar findings from other ecosystems have led to a general acceptance that invasive plants, especially annual grasses, are nitrophilous. Consequently, reductions of soil nitrogen via carbon amendments have been conducted by many researchers in a variety of ecosystems in order to disproportionately lower invasive species abundance, but with mixed success. Recent studies suggest that resource-use traits may predict the efficacy of such resource manipulations; however, this theory remains largely untested. We report findings from a carbon amendment experiment that utilized two levels of sucrose additions that were aimed at achieving soil carbon to nitrogen ratios of 50:1 and 100:1 in labile sources. Carbon amendments were applied once each year, for three years, corresponding with the first large precipitation event of each wet season. Plant functional traits measured on the three invasive and 11 native herbaceous species that were most common at the study site showed that exotic and native species did not differ in traits associated with nitrogen use. In fact, plant abundance measures such as density, cover, and biomass showed that carbon amendments were capable of decreasing both native and invasive species. We found that early-germinating species were the most impacted by decreased soil nitrogen resulting from amendments. Because invasive annuals typically germinate earlier and exhibit a rapid phenology compared to most natives, these species are expected to be more competitive than native annuals yet more susceptible to early-season carbon amendments. However, desert annual communities can exhibit high interannual variability in species composition and abundance. Therefore, the relative abundance of native and invasive species at the time of application is critical to the success of carbon amendments at our study site. For land management purposes, carbon amendments remain relatively impractical and may only be useful at small scales or in conjunction with other invasive species removal techniques.

Hence, global climate change is altering these environmental cues and will preclude, delay, or enhance regeneration from seeds, as already documented in some cases. Along with compromised seedling emergence and vigour, shifts in germination phenology will influence population dynamics, and thus, species composition and diversity of communities. Altered seed maturation (including consequences for dispersal) and seed mass will have ramifications on life history traits of plants. Predicted changes in temperature and precipitation, and thus in soil moisture, will affect many components of seed persistence in soil, e.g. seed longevity, dormancy release and germination, and soil pathogen activity. More/less equitable climate will alter geographic distribution for species, but restricted migratory capacity in some will greatly limit their response. Seed traits for weedy species could evolve relatively quickly to keep pace with climate change enhancing their negative environmental and economic impact. Thus, increased research in understudied ecosystems, on key issues related to seed ecology, and on evolution of seed traits in nonweedy species is needed to more fully comprehend and plan for plant responses to global warming.

J	Ju, EJ; Kim, JG				Ju, Eun Jeong; Kim, Jae Geun			Using soil seed banks for ecological education in primary school	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL EDUCATION												In this study, we developed an educational programme using soil seed banks to promote ecological literacy among primary school-aged children. The programme consisted of seven student activities, including sampling and setting soil seed banks around the school, watering, identifying seedlings, and making observations about the plants and their environments. Research was conducted in two urban elementary schools in Seoul, Korea with 99 fourth-grade students, who were divided into two experimental groups that engaged in the soil seed bank programme and a control group that followed the official textbook-based curriculum for studying lima bean seed growth. After participating in this programme, the level of student concepts about the relationship between plant distribution and the environment increased significantly in comparison with a control group (p<0.01), as did student knowledge about plants and plant ecology (p<0.01). In addition, the programme was associated with increases in eco-centric attitudes among the students (p<0.01), including a shift toward more positive attitudes about plants. According to the participants, the programme better enabled students to recognise and observe temporal changes in plants and nature, providing one indication that their ecological sensibilities were augmented by the student activities in which they engaged. Both the participating students and the teachers leading the activities expressed a belief that the programme benefited the participating students, and that the activities were interesting and useful. This study showed that a programme of activities using soil seed banks and seedling emergence methods promoted ecological literacy by providing simple, hands-on opportunities to experience and inquire about local plants and their environments.

J	Sanchez, AC; Osborne, PE; Haq, N				Sanchez, Aida Cuni; Osborne, Patrick E.; Haq, Nazmul			Climate change and the African baobab (Adansonia digitata L.): the need for better conservation strategies	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The baobab tree, with more than 300 uses and commercial value in EU and United States, has been identified as one of the most important trees to be conserved and domesticated in Africa. A decline in baobab populations because of changes in climate could have a negative effect on African livelihoods. Therefore, it is important to study the potential future distribution of this species and determine strategies for conservation. We used Maxent, 480 geo-referenced records, present and future climatic and soil layers. Different general circulation models and scenarios were selected. Models were simulated for (i) All records, (ii) East Africa and (iii) West Africa species records. For each combination, the proportion of the present habitat that might remain suitable in the future was determined. These habitat proportions were compared with the Protected Areas in Africa. Although potential future distributions were different depending on model, scenario and records used, in all cases only a percentage of the present distribution was predicted to remain suitable in the future. Some countries were found to have no suitable habitat in the future. Recommendations for different conservation strategies include in situ conservation in Protected Areas; ex situ conservation in seed banks; and conservation through 'sustainable utilization'.Resume Le baobab, pour lequel on connait 300 utilisations et valeurs commerciales dans l'UE et les U.S.A., a ete identifie comme l'un des arbres dont la conservation et la domestication sont les plus importantes en Afrique. Un declin des populations de baobabs du aux changements climatiques pourrait avoir un impact negatif sur les moyens de subsistance des Africains. Il est des lors important d'etudier la future distribution potentielle de cette espece et de determiner des strategies pour sa conservation. Nous avons utilise Maxent, 480 donnees georeferencees, des couches de donnees sur l'etude et la prediction du climat, ainsi que sur les sols. Nous avons choisi differents modeles de circulation generale et differents scenarios. Nous avons cree des modeles pour (i) l'ensemble des donnees et (ii) les donnees sur l'espece en Afrique de l'Est et (iii) en Afrique de l'ouest. Pour chaque combinaison, la proportion de l'habitat actuel qui pourrait rester propice a l'avenir a ete determinee. Ces differentes proportions ont ete comparees avec les aires protegees africaines. Bien que les distributions futures potentielles soient differentes selon les modeles, les scenarios et les donnees utilisees, l'on predisait dans tous les cas que seul un certain pourcentage de la distribution actuelle resterait adaptea l'avenir. Pour certains pays, on a trouve qu'il ne resterait aucun habitat propice dans le futur. Les recommandations en matiere de strategies de conservation incluent : la conservation in situ dans des aires protegees, la conservation in situ dans des banques de semences et la conservation par une 'utilisation durable'.																	0141-6707	1365-2028				JUN	2011	49	2					234	245		10.1111/j.1365-2028.2011.01257.x							WOS:000290171900011

Can a seed bank provide demographic and genetic rescue in a declining population of the endangered shrub Acacia pinguifolia?	CONSERVATION GENETICS												Many threatened species suffer reduced genetic diversity as a result of small population size and isolation. However, species with a persistent seed bank may be buffered against genetic loss as seed banks are expected to accumulate the reproductive output of many seasons. For fire-dependent species in decline, prescribed ecological burning may be a means to stimulate germination and recover genetic diversity stored in the seed bank, providing a demographic and genetic rescue effect. Here we investigated the effectiveness of this strategy in a small, isolated and inbred population of the endangered shrub, Acacia pinguifolia. We surveyed genetic diversity and structure of remnant populations of A. pinguifolia and monitored regeneration before and after burning. Germination was stimulated by fire, but seedling numbers 18 months post-fire were low and barely above the number of adults killed by the fire. Genetic diversity was marginally higher in the post-fire seedling cohort than the pre-fire adults (H(E) = 0.1 vs. 0.09, respectively). Outcrossing rates of open-pollinated seed from surrounding plants suggested moderately high levels of self-fertilisation (t (m) = 0.65) and analysis of fine-scale genetic structure implied pollen and seed dispersal over distances of several metres, suggesting that restricted gene flow and inbreeding may act to limit genetic diversity in the seed bank. We conclude that prescribed burning has not been immediately successful as a recovery strategy for this relictual population of A. pinguifolia, though future monitoring may detect additional recruits. Alternative conservation strategies, including performing inter-population crosses, may be required to restore genetic diversity and ameliorate extinction risks.

A generic model for an innovative crop protection system has been used as a framework. This system will be able to monitor the entire cropping system and identify the presence of relevant pests, diseases and weeds online, and will be location specific. The system will offer prevention, monitoring, interpretation and action which will be performed in a continuous way. The monitoring is divided into several parts. Planting material, seeds and soil should be monitored for prevention purposes before the growing period to avoid, for example, the introduction of disease into the field and to ensure optimal growth conditions. Data from previous growing seasons, such as the location of weeds and previous diseases, should also be included. During the growing season, the crop will be monitored at a macroscale level until a location that needs special attention is identified. If relevant, this area will be monitored more intensively at a microscale level. A decision engine will analyse the data and offer advice on how to control the detected diseases, pests and weeds, using precision spray techniques or alternative measures. The goal is to provide tools that are able to produce high-quality products with the minimal use of conventional plant protection products. This review describes the technologies that can be used or that need further development in order to achieve this goal.

Impact of the quality of organic amendments on size and composition of the weed seed bank	WEED RESEARCH												P>In addition to improving the soil quality, organic amendments of soils may affect weed seed survival, emergence, growth and reproduction. This study evaluated the effects of applications of different qualities of organic amendments on size and composition of the weed seed bank in a field under sequential cropping over 4 years. Fertilisation systems tested included farmyard manure, vegetable fruit and garden waste compost, two types of farm compost differing in carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratio, cattle slurry and mineral fertiliser. All organically amended plots received equal amounts of C. Crop growth was equalised on all plots by applying supplemental mineral N. Seed bank sampling took place in May 2009 to a depth of 10 cm. The weed seed bank was analysed using the seedling emergence method. Despite equal crop growth in fertilised plots, total seed bank density was lowest in plots amended with compost with low C:N ratio and highest in slurry-amended plots. Observed differences in seed bank densities reflected differences in soil organic carbon content and microbial biomass. At plot level, hard-coated seeds in the seed bank (e.g. Chenopodium spp.) were inversely related to soil microbial activity. Observed differential responses of species to applied fertilisers might be attributed to interspecific differences in resistance against microbial seed degradation. Compost-based fertilisation systems could be sustainable tools for incorporation into integrated weed control strategies aiming at depleting the weed seed bank.																	0043-1737					JUN	2011	51	3					250	260		10.1111/j.1365-3180.2010.00840.x							WOS:000290168000005

In the savannas of Central Brazil, we studied seed characteristics (type of dormancy, longevity and moisture content) of 14 representative woody species differing in seed dispersal season. We also studied the dynamics of soil seed-banks and similarity patterns in woody species composition among seed rain, soil seed-bank, seedling bank and standing vegetation along shallow topographic gradients that differ in canopy cover. Woody species composition of the soil seed-bank largely differed from the standing vegetation, the seed rain and the seedling bank species composition, suggesting low recruitment of woody species from the soil seed-bank. Seeds of the 14 woody species remained viable for less than 16 months in laboratory dry-storage conditions. Of those, most seeds dispersed in the dry season were dormant and exhibited low moisture content, while most seeds dispersed in the wet season were non-dormant and exhibited high moisture content. Longevity of these seeds dispersed in the dry and the wet seasons did not differ significantly. This study shows that both timing of seed dispersal and dormancy appear to control timing of seed germination and seedling recruitment of most Neotropical savanna woody species, which did not form persistent soil seed-banks. This study contributes to the understanding of tree/grass coexistence and tree density variations along topographic gradients in tropical savannas.

Soil blocks 25 x 25 x 30 cm(3) were sampled during two growing seasons from June to September. The total rhizome buds comprised the largest proportion of L. chinensis bud banks except for September of 2004 (juvenile tillers were the most). The top rhizome buds were the most of C. duriuscula bud banks. The percentages of total buds derived from tiller nodes and rhizomes of both species were nearly equal in the two-year study period. The productivity of L. chinensis and contribution of bud banks to population persistence were higher than those of C. duriuscula. Size of bud banks of L. chinensis was not significant between the end of two sampling seasons (1039.2 and 1232.0 buds/m(2)), and buds significantly decreased in C. duriuscula (1140.0 and 581.6 buds/m(2)). Over the two studied seasons, decreasing number of buds and low productivity as well as small contribution indicate that C. duriuscula which spread after flood event will be successively replaced by L. chinensis.																	1991-637X					MAY 18	2011	6	10					2198	2203									WOS:000292269500010

The highest density of soil seed bank of 3946 seeds m(-2) was found in grassland in summit plain, and lowest of 225 seeds m(-2) in the dwarf scrub grassland in shady slope, while the highest numbers of species of 21 species in per sampled area of 962 cm(2) was found in grassland in sunny slope and lowest of 5 species in per sampled area of 962 cm(2) in scrub land in shady slope. Of the species 18% were annuals and 73% perennial herbs, only 1 shrub of Salix gilashanica was recorded. Considerably more seeds were concentrated in the upper layer (0 to 5 cm), and seed density declined by 71.10% in the lower layer (5 to 10 cm). There was a tendency for the soil seed bank to decrease in density with increasing elevation in both shady slope and sunny slope, although this pattern is complicated by the occurrence of different plant communities and species at different altitudes. Sorensen similarity index between soil seed bank and vegetation of the seven habitats was very low, and Picea crassifolia was absent in the soil seed bank despite being a prominent component of the surface vegetation at woodlands; thus, P. crassifolia has no persistent seed bank. It will be important to maintain the existing vegetation in the future management.

The chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rate of S. photeinocarpum were not affected by Cd pollution, while leaf stomas and transpiration rate were significantly decreased by more than 60 mg kg(-1) Cd, and leaf water use efficiency and shoot water content were significantly increased by more than 60 or 100 mg kg(-1) Cd, respectively. In the seed bank-Cd concentration gradient experiment, the shoot biomass of S. photeinocarpum showed no significant reduction with soil Cd treatment as high as 100 mg kg(-1), but the root biomass was significantly reduced by more than 60 mg kg(-1) Cd contamination. Plant tissues accumulated 544, 132 and 158 mg kg Cd in roots, stems and leaves, respectively, and extracted 157 and 195 mu g Cd plant(-1) in roots and shoots at 100 mg kg(-1) Cd in soil, respectively. In the transplanting-Cd concentration gradient experiment, plant shoot biomass and root biomass were unaffected by soil Cd as high as 60 mg kg(-1).

As most Miconia species are considered pioneers species, the tested hypothesis was that the analyzed species pairs presented individuals with total or partial habitat overlapping. Considering the history of the area, it is possible to assume that all individuals regenerate from the rain and the seed bank. It was established a transect crossing the study area toward its longest length from where it was determined the coordinates of individuals from Miconia genus with DSL (diameter at soil level) greater or equal to 1 cm. Spatial association among individual from different species were analyzed through bivariate Ripley's K function. It was sampled the following species: Miconia pepericarpa DC., Miconia sellowiana Naudin, Miconia albicans Triana, Miconia argyrophylla DC., Miconia chartacea Triana and Miconia cinnamomifolia (DC.) Naudin. Overall, the results demonstrated the lack of negative spatial association between species pairs, indicating that Miconia spp. individuals share partially or totally the same space in a eucalyptus plantation understory. Although the results cannot be extrapolated to other species, they support the idea that some pioneer species tend to coexist in tropical forests, in areas with high light availability.				van den Berg, eduardo/L-9617-2014; da Silva, Ana Carolina/Z-2859-2019; Pifano, Daniel S./G-1233-2013; Higuchi, Pedro/C-3345-2013	van den Berg, eduardo/0000-0002-0843-6437; da Silva, Ana Carolina/0000-0002-1285-640X; Higuchi, Pedro/0000-0002-3855-555X												0100-6762					MAY-JUN	2011	35	3					381	389		10.1590/S0100-67622011000300002							WOS:000293654500002

These 2 options can foster secondary forest succession by improving soil conditions, attracting seed-dispersal agents, and modifying microclimate for understory growth. We compared native woody plant diversity and soil chemical and physical attributes under exclosure and on Eucalyptus globulus (EGP) and Cupressus lusitanica (CLP) plantations. Vegetation data were collected by an inventory of stands with circular plots of 5.64 m radius, and soil samples were collected from the 4 corners and center of 20 x 20 m plots. As a result, 15 native woody plant species belonging to 13 families were recorded. Importance value index (IVI), Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's diversity, and species richness were higher in the exclosure, followed by EGP and CLP. Contents of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen showed significance difference and were highest in the exclosure, followed by CLP, EGP, and grazing land. Although the difference was not significant, an increasing trend was observed for cation exchange capacity and K(+). Bulk density was highest on the grazing land, followed by EGP, CLP, and exclosure. Our results suggest that degraded land reclamation can be achieved with plantation of rapidly growing tree species as well as exclosure. However, native woody species diversity and improved soil attributes are better achieved with exclosure. Exclosures can be established interspersed strategically with single-or mixed-species plantations to facilitate restoration of native vegetation. However, it is important to conduct further research on the comparative advantage of enrichment planting of exclosures with preferred tree species or exclosures interspersed within blocks of plantation.

Mason; Haner, Emily; Shea, Katriona			Tolerance of two invasive thistles to repeated disturbance	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												Many invasive species have short life cycles, high reproduction, and easily dispersed offspring that make them good ruderal species under disturbance. However, the tolerance of such ruderal species to disturbance is often overlooked. In a 2-year mowing study, we applied frequent intense disturbances to examine the tolerance of two congeneric invasive thistles, Carduus acanthoides and Carduus nutans, and potential differences in their responses. Our results show that both species can survive multiple mowing events, with C. acanthoides surviving repeated intense mowing through a whole season. Furthermore, C. acanthoides was found to adjust its growth form to the disturbance regime, and successfully overwintered and reproduced in the subsequent growing season if the disturbance was terminated. Our results support the idea that tolerance to disturbance should be considered when examining invasions by short-lived monocarpic species, since avoidance of disturbance via rapid life cycle completion and seed production, and tolerance of disturbance via regrowth can co-occur in these species. Consequently, management of short-lived invasives should take both life history strategies into account.

Growth, fire history, and browsing recorded in wood rings of shrubs in a mild temperate climate	ECOLOGY												Separate effects of abiotic and biotic factors on the structure and dynamics of ecological communities may be recorded in growth rings of woody plants. We used Ceanothus cuneatus rigidus and Arctostaphylos pumila to tease apart the roles of fire, rain, and herbivores on the histories and community structure of four areas in a coastal mediterranean-type climate in central California with mild winters and mild summers. Ring widths of both species were related to rainfall in two of the areas; heavy deer browsing on Ceanothus overwhelmed the climate signal in the others. Ceanothus germination was more closely related to heavy rainfall, especially during ENSO years, than to fire events. In a related greenhouse experiment that evaluated these observations, the same proportions of new Ceanothus seeds germinated after burning and after receiving regular water for several months, but germination of old seeds responded primarily to the fire treatment. In areas where heavy browsing by mammals reduces recruitment and growth of Ceanothus and increases mortality, the continuance of the Ceanothus population must rely heavily on germination from the persistent seed bank during unusually wet years or after occasional fires. Because Arctostaphylos can produce new stems from underground roots, individual plants may survive and produce seeds until another fire.																	0012-9658					MAY	2011	92	5					1020	1026									WOS:000290534300003	21661563

Soil samples were collected at 14 points and were then placed in a greenhouse to allow germination to occur. Each sample point had the flood level monitored, the elevation measured and the soil properties identified. A total of 1710 seedlings from 26 species were recorded, of which Echinodorus tenelus was the most abundant (24.9%). Cyperaceae and Poaceae were the richest floristic families (5 species each), with Alismataceae the most represented in terms of number of individuals (36% of the total). Duration of flooding plays an important role in determining Pantanal soil seed banks. The flood pulse influences the abundance (r = 0.79; P = 0.006; partial), richness (r = 0.61; P = 0.02; partial) and composition of the soil seed bank (Pillai trace = 0.552; P = 0.027), carrying the seeds to areas where the duration of flood is longer. Except for aluminium, the soil characteristics expressed by the first principal component of PCA exert indirect positive effects on the seed bank. This is because this component was correlated with the duration of inundation (r = 0.76). Elevation and the toxic effect of aluminium do not vary sufficiently to be able to influence seed bank characteristics. The correlograms show that soil seed banks have no discernible spatial pattern, even though most species are dispersed hydrochorically. This suggests that, at the scale of the study, the tendency for flooding to cause homogeneous dispersion has no influence on seed-bank spatial structure, because of the complexity of flood-plain geomorphology.

In the case of GMHT crops this includes assessing the environmental impact of the changes in weed management in GMHT crops and farming systems. EFSA is currently updating its guidance on the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of GM plants and is specifically considering these types of interactions when compared with conventional weed management practices. In an ERA, the main features to be considered and assessed are: (1) Impacts of the changed management of the GMHT crops on farmland biodiversity. (2) Impacts of changed management of HT volunteers and seed bank populations on farmland biodiversity. (3) Environmental consequences of changes in management resulting from gene flow of the HT trait to other crop, weed and wild species, including plants already containing other GM events and herbicide tolerances. (4) Environmental consequences of the development of herbicide resistance in weeds exposed to the herbicides associated with HT crops. When an ERA identifies potential risks (e.g. to farmland biodiversity), then EFSA is requesting that applicants propose management measures to mitigate or limit the environmental harm, including the introduction of stewardship and post market monitoring programmes. These should be done in conjunction with appropriate stakeholders in each member state in order to optimise the use of the herbicides for both local agronomic and environmental requirements.																	1661-5751	1661-5867				MAY	2011	6			1			65	72		10.1007/s00003-011-0686-3							WOS:000290541800011

An integrated approach for the conservation of threatened plants: The case of Arabis kennedyae (Brassicaceae)	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												The aim of this paper is to propose an integrated approach (including population and habitat monitoring and the study of reproductive biology and genetic diversity) for the comprehensive study of threatened plants, for which conservation measures are imperative. We applied this model to the plant species Arabis kennedyae which is classified as endangered according to the IUCN criteria. The current population of the species consists of three small subpopulations (AR1, AR2, and AR3) at three locations. Population size was characterized by considerable annual fluctuations. The distribution pattern of the plant followed habitat availability. Relative Reproductive Success remained stable but moderate. Germination of dormant seeds was promoted by light and was optimal at 15 and 20 degrees C. Genetic analysis showed low interpopulation variability and detected two groups: haplotype I (AR1 and AR3) and haplotype II (AR2), which may represent two altitudinal ecotypes. The direct threats identified were related to recreation activities, road construction and fire. The subpopulations of the plant are regulated by density and depend on fecundity and on the soil seedbank while their persistence depends mainly on habitat availability. Low genetic diversity combined with small population size and a possible reduction in fitness suggest increased susceptibility to loss of genetic variation. The overall results suggest that ex situ conservation in a seed bank, and in situ conservation in the form of population restoration, are suitable conservation measures and the study of the different aspects of the species biology has provided the data required for their implementation.

J	Busch, JW				Busch, Jeremiah W.			DEMOGRAPHY, POLLINATION, AND BAKER'S LAW	EVOLUTION												Baker's Law states that selfing should commonly be selected during dispersal because bottlenecks during colonization limit the availability of mates. Although this truism has broad intuitive appeal, a recent body of theory (<link rid="b6">Cheptou and Massol 2009; <link rid="b14">Massol and Cheptou 2011) casts doubt on whether adaptation favors both selfing and dispersal when both parameters are free to evolve. In these models, the joint evolution of dispersal and the selfing rate are considered in a metapopulation, with a spatially and temporally variable pollination environment. Under these conditions, adaptation favors one of two strategies: the "dispersal/outcrosser" syndrome and the "no dispersal/selfing" syndrome. These results appear to contradict the prediction of Baker's Law. These models clarify how variation in the pollination environment per se cannot generate an association between selfing and dispersal. That being said, demographic factors during dispersal episodes are likely to be important in generating patterns consistent with Baker's law. Determining whether Baker's law maintains its predictive utility requires determining whether seed banks, the perennial habit, multiple introductions, or the simultaneous arrival of many founders weaken selection for selfing during the bottleneck associated with a dispersal event. These issues highlight the many assumptions that are necessary for Baker's law to hold.

Quantification of virus genes provides evidence for seed-bank populations of phycodnaviruses in Lake Ontario, Canada	ISME JOURNAL												Using quantitative PCR, the abundances of six phytoplankton viruses DNA polymerase (polB) gene fragments were estimated in water samples collected from Lake Ontario, Canada over 26 months. Four of the polB fragments were most related to marine prasinoviruses, while the other two were most closely related to cultivated chloroviruses. Two Prasinovirus-related genes reached peak abundances of >1000 copies ml(-1) and were considered 'high abundance', whereas the other two Prasinovirus-related genes peaked at abundances <1000 copies ml(-1) and were considered 'low abundance'. Of the genes related to chloroviruses, one peaked at ca 1600 copies ml(-1), whereas the other reached only ca 300 copies ml(-1). Despite these differences in peak abundance, the abundances of all genes monitored were lowest during the late fall, winter and early spring; during these months the high abundance genes persisted at 100-1000 copies ml(-1) while the low abundance Prasinovirus- and Chlorovirus-related genes persisted at fewer than ca 100 copies ml(-1). Clone libraries of psbA genes from Lake Ontario revealed numerous Chlorella-like algae and two prasinophytes demonstrating the presence of candidate hosts for all types of viruses monitored. Our results corroborate recent metagenomic analyses that suggest that aquatic virus communities are composed of only a few abundant populations and many low abundance populations. Thus, we speculate that an ecologically important characteristic of phycodnavirus communities is seed-bank populations with members that can become numerically dominant when their host abundances reach appropriate levels.

Species, functional groups and community structure in seed banks of the arid Nama Karoo: Grazing impacts and implications for rangeland restoration	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The regeneration potential of grazing-affected Nama Karoo vegetation was evaluated by comparing soil seed banks of different microsites across a fence-line contrast in arid Namibia. Seed banks under low and high grazing pressure reflected the condition of the standing vegetation in terms of composition, community structure and species abundance distributions. However, a close concordance between vegetation and seed bank was restricted to the herbaceous and grassy vegetation within the inter-shrub matrix. The divergence of seed bank communities across the fence-line was low at community level but high at the level of species abundances. Continuous severe grazing increased the abundance of small-seeded, prostrate forbs with round seeds and favored unpalatable, annual grasses over palatable, perennial grasses. Microsites provided a source of small-scale variation in seed bank community composition and were dissimilar between the rangelands. Results indicated an advanced divergence in the vegetation at the degraded site with seed banks of species common under sustainable grazing being drastically reduced. Their low abundance, even in safe sites, suggests that long-distance dispersal is one of the main limiting factors for natural re-establishment after disturbance. The inertia in recovery of Namibian degraded rangelands through seed limitation can be overcome only by active species introduction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												The number of ex situ conservation facilities has grown dramatically in recent years, and they have become increasingly integrated under national and regional conservation initiatives. However, little information is available about the extent to which plant species are appropriately represented in ex situ collections. This paper assesses whether seed/spore collections stored in European seed banks cover or not, and to what extent, the species currently threatened with extinction in the wild. Although a substantial amount of the European flora (ca. 70%) is currently stored in seed banks, we highlight the relatively poor representation of threatened species: only 27% of the taxa listed on the European threatened plant list and 44% of the taxa listed in Annex II of the EU Habitat Directive are stored in European seed banks. Some taxonomical groups most at risk, e.g. Pteridophytes and Orchidaceae, are also under-represented in European seed banks. By examining the number of accessions per species and the number of seeds per accession, this study also gave some insight on how well species are conserved, considering that these two variables are surrogates for genetic diversity. We have highlighted that at least two thirds of the threatened species stored in European seed banks likely suffer from too low genetic diversity in the collections. These analyses were essential to identify those collections and additionally the standards needed to maximize the usefulness of future collections. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The concentration of seeds in the soil surface layers tends to favour the development of species capable of germinating rapidly (low dormancy) and to favour perennial species. Although a higher reliance on herbicides is observed with reduced tillage, applying the principles of Integrated Weed Management (IWM) can reduce herbicide use while ensuring satisfactory management of the weed flora. The compatibility of IWM and low-tillage systems was demonstrated in a long-term experiment designed to evaluate various IWM-based systems, including the frequent application of shallow tillage to enhance weed seed germination before sowing the crop. In these fields, as compared to the reference standard system, the Treatment Frequency Index for herbicides was drastically decreased over the six years of crop rotation. During the same period, the soil seed bank and the above ground flora were kept under control. The demography of blackgrass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds.) fluctuated considerably in these systems, increasing or decreasing very rapidly according to the agronomic practices of the current year.																	1777-5949					MAY-JUN	2011	20	3					194	203		10.1684/agr.2011.0491							WOS:000292318400003

Climate extremes are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude as a consequence of global warming. 2. Managed permanent grasslands cover a large surface in Europe and contribute substantially to agricultural production. These managed plant communities are dominated by perennial clonal species. Their capacity to adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions may be limited. 3. We hypothesize that those plant populations that have already been exposed to conditions that are expected to occur due to future climate change, particularly conditions that would be 'extreme' in the target area, are able to cope better with these conditions. 4. For a common-garden experiment we selected ecotypes (provenances as supported by accessions in seed banks) of important European grass species: Arrhenatherum elatius, Festuca pratensis, Holcus lanatus and Alopecurus pratensis. Southern target locations of ecotypes (populations) were identified based on climate model projections for the local site in Northern Bavaria, Germany. 5. In a controlled experiment, the plants were exposed to warming and extreme drought. Drought conditions(16-19 days, depending on the species) were imposed starting from the end of May in combination with and without an increase in the average temperature from May to September 2009 (+1.5 K compared with control; +2.5 K compared with ambient conditions outside of the experimental units). 6. Ecotypes and drought manipulation had significant impacts on biomass production and tissue die-back. Significant interactions between ecotype and drought indicated a different drought tolerance of the ecotypes in some cases. The warming treatment yielded a less significant response. The local ecotype generally did not perform significantly worse than the presumably better-adapted southern ecotypes. 7. Synthesis. The selection of ecotypes that are adapted to more extreme climatic conditions could be an option for maintaining future ecosystem functioning in temperate managed grasslands, as was indicated by the clear differences between ecotypes in our experiment. Based on our data, however, performance cannot be predicted from climatic origin. Therefore, we recommend enhancing the genetic variability within populations of species in general.

Geographical variation on cone and seed production of natural Pinus halepensis Mill. forests in Tunisia	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) is found in discontinuous bands along the Mediterranean Basin, usually at low elevations and in dry climates. This study was conducted to relate bioclimatic zones and geographic distribution with representative individual tree of populations for cone number and weight from the driest to the wettest Aleppo pine forest zones. Epidometric values were recorded in all sample stands in the monitoring plots set in 79 native populations from the Algerian border to the eastern coast of Tunisia, representing a wide range from each region in northern Africa. Simple and multiple regressions were performed on the data. Results showed that the canopy seed bank increased according to elevation, latitudinal and longitudinal gradients. The simple regression analysis showed a latitudinal effect positively relating increasing latitude to greater cone crop. Similarly, longitudinal and elevation variations were related to significant differences in cone dimensions. Higher average seed mass was related to populations located westwards or at higher elevation. The multiple regression analysis indicated that the longitudinal variations were the most determinant geo-positional factors in Aleppo pine cone dimensions and average seed mass in natural Aleppo pine forests in Tunisia.

Water use efficiency and drought survival in Mediterranean perennial forage grasses	FIELD CROPS RESEARCH												In Mediterranean areas, water use efficiency (WUE) is mainly increased by maximising crop growth during the rainy seasons. Perennial forage species have a number of advantages in comparison to the predominantly used annuals. They can utilize water from autumn to spring, while annuals need to be sown or to germinate from the soil seed bank. Under Mediterranean annual rainfall pattern, perennial plants must grow from autumn to spring and survive under summer aridity. Drought survival can impact water use efficiency through plant mortality and stand recovery after autumn rainfalls. In order to enhance knowledge of physiological and agronomic traits associated with WUE and persistence, a 3-year study was conducted at two Mediterranean sites, comparing a range of accessions of two perennial species, cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L) and tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum (Schreb.) Darbysh). Within the accessions of predominantly Mediterranean origin, we defined four major functional types, i.e. groups of accessions with similar response to summer drought. One type (FT1) is represented by the only cultivar of a semi-arid cocksfoot (Kasbah) that is completely summer dormant, with high persistence under the most arid situations but with low WUE. The type FT2 all cocksfoot cultivars (Currie, Delta-1, Jana, Medly, and Ottava) that are not or less summer dormant, with good perenniality and intermediate productivity at rainy seasons. The type FT3 includes the cultivars of tall fescue (Centurion, Flecha, Fraydo, and Tank) that combine an incomplete summer dormancy, a deep rooting system and the highest WUE from autumn to spring. The type FT4 is represented by a cultivar of tall fescue (Sisa) with no summer dormancy, therefore less persistent and also less productive. Dehydration avoidance in tall fescue and cocksfoot and summer dormancy in cocksfoot were the main strategies contributing to persistence under summer drought. WUE in autumn was highly correlated with sward recovery after drought. Seasonal and total WUE were also highly correlated with biomass production over the same period and with depth and density of the root system. Parameterization of functional types of the major species of forage grasses will enhance future modelling work to test the effects of a range of environments and future climate scenarios.

Restoring diversity after cattail expansion: disturbance, resilience, and seasonality in a tropical dry wetland	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												As the human footprint expands, ecologists and resource managers are increasingly challenged to explain and manage abrupt ecosystem transformations (i.e., regime shifts). In this study, we investigated the role of a mechanical disturbance that has been used to restore and maintain local wetland diversity after a monotypic regime shift in northwestern Costa Rica [specifically, an abrupt landscape-scale cattail (Typha) expansion]. The study was conducted in Palo Verde Marsh (Palo Verde National Park; a RAMSAR Wetland of International Importance), a seasonally flooded freshwater wetland that has historically provided habitat for large populations of wading birds and waterfowl. A cattail (T. domingensis) expansion in the 1980s greatly altered the plant community and reduced avian habitat. Since then, Typha has been managed using a form of mechanical disturbance called fangueo (a Spanish word, pronounced "fahn-gay-yo" in English). We applied a Typha removal treatment at three levels (control, fangueo, and fangueo with fencing to exclude cattle grazing). Fangueo resulted in a large reduction in Typha dominance (i.e., decreased aboveground biomass, ramet density, and ramet height) and an increase in habitat heterogeneity. As in many ecosystems that have been defined by multiple and frequent disturbances, a large portion of the plant community regenerated after disturbance (via propagule banking) and fangueo resulted in a more diverse plant community that was strongly dictated by seasonal processes (i.e., distinct wet-and dry-season assemblages). Importantly, the mechanical disturbance had no apparent short-term impact on any of the soil properties we measured (including bulk density). Interestingly, low soil and foliar N:P values indicate that Palo Verde Marsh and other wetlands in the region may be nitrogen limited. Our results quantify how, in a cultural landscape where the historical disturbance regime has been altered and diversity has declined, a mechanical disturbance in combination with seasonal drought and flooding has been used to locally restrict a clonal monodominant plant expansion, create habitat heterogeneity, and maintain plant diversity.

Effect of a Living Mulch on Weed Seed Banks in Tomato	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Weeds that emerge between rows in fresh market tomatoes after the critical period of competition are not suppressed by the crop and can produce large quantities of seed. A living mulch planted between rows might limit weed seed production. Buckwheat was seeded between tomato rows after the critical period in 2007 and 2008 in field studies near Lafayette, IN. Weeds were allowed to emerge after the critical period (CP), controlled throughout the growing season (no seed threshold [NST]), or mowed to limit seed production (MOW). Buckwheat and MOW plots were mowed twice after the critical period in 2007 and once in 2008. Seed banks were sampled after the critical period and in the following spring. Tomato yields were not reduced by growing buckwheat between rows. Seed bank densities for common purslane and carpetweed, which escaped mowing due to their prostrate habits, increased in all treatments. Germinable seed bank densities were 306 seeds m(-2) or less in the NST and buckwheat treatments but 755 seeds m(-2) or more in the CP treatments for species with erect habits in both years. Seed bank densities were lower in the MOW treatment than in the CP treatments in 2007 but not in 2008. In a parallel experiment conducted in adjacent plots, buckwheat was seeded at five rates (0, 56, 112, 168, and 224 kg seed ha(-1)). Plots were mowed and emergent weeds sampled as described for the intercrop experiment. Weed densities before mowing decreased linearly with buckwheat seed rate. After mowing, no relationship was detected between seed rate and weed densities. This study supports the hypothesis that a living mulch planted after the critical period can be used to limit seed bank growth without reducing tomato yields, but additional research is needed to better understand the effect of mowing on living mulch growth and weed suppression.																	0890-037X	1550-2740				APR-JUN	2011	25	2					245	251		10.1614/WT-D-10-00101.1							WOS:000290668000011

LATIFOLIA (PINACEAE) FORESTS AFTER A MOUNTAIN PINE BEETLE OUTBREAK	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the study: Seed banks are important for the natural regeneration of many forest species. Most of the seed bank of serotinous lodgepole pine is found in the canopy, but after an outbreak of mountain pine beetle (MPB), a considerable forest-floor seed bank develops through the falling of canopy cones. After large-scale mortality of pine stands from MPB, however, the viability of seeds in both the canopy and the forest-floor cone bank is uncertain. Methods: We sampled cones in five stands 3 yr after MPB (3y-MPB); five stands 6 yr after MPB (6y-MPB); and 10 stands 9 yr after MPB (9y-MPB), in central British Columbia, Canada. Seeds were extracted and viability tested using germination techniques. Key results: Forest-floor cones had seed with high germination capacity (GC): 82% for embedded (partly buried) closed cones vs. 45% for buried partly open cones. For canopy cones, GC steeply declined about 15 yr after cone maturation and by 25 yr, GC was 50%, compared with 98% in the first year. In the 3y- and 6y-MPB stands, seeds from cones that were 7 to 9 yr old had similar GC on dead and living trees; however, seeds from the dead trees had lower vigor than seeds from living trees. Conclusions: We demonstrate for the first time that a serotinous pine can form a viable soil seed bank by cone burial, which may facilitate natural regeneration if a secondary disturbance occurs. Seeds contained in 15-yr-old cones showed a steep decline in viability, which could limit regeneration if there is a long delay before a secondary disturbance.

Distribution was determined by field surveys and mapping. To estimate population size and density 81 permanent monitoring plots were randomly established. Ex situ conservation measures were activated by harvesting and appropriate storage of seed. We confirmed the presence of L. microcephala at two previously known sites and found it in two previously unknown localities. The areas in which the species occur vary from 200 to 240,000 m(2), at altitudes of 1,450-1,820 m, on slopes of 15-45 degrees with aspects from north to west. The estimated number of ramets per population varied from c. 2,000 to c. 2,000,000, with a mean density of 8.29 +/- SD 14.3 to 10.33 +/- SD 10.05 ramets m(-2). Our findings confirmed the Critically Endangered status of this species, although with different criteria. This study is an example of an integrated approach for the conservation of an extremely narrow endemic plant species and may be useful for other little-known threatened species for which urgent conservation measures are needed.

The effect of reseeding methods on secondary succession during cropland restoration in the Highveld region of South Africa	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												The Grassland biome is the most transformed biome in South Africa, with cultivation and other human impacts having the largest effect on pristine grasslands. Conversion of natural grassland to cropland agriculture destroys natural vegetation seed banks. When croplands on the South African Highveld are abandoned, secondary succession often leads to low diversity Hyparrhenia hirta dominated plant communities. To investigate the effect of reseeding on secondary succession and botanical diversity, various reseeding treatments of cropland restoration were established on a recently abandoned cropland at Suikerbosrand Nature Reserve. Plots combining two seed mixtures, two seeding rates and two sowing methods were monitored and evaluated. The sowing method (plough vs rip-line) had the largest influence on the suppression of relic weeds as well as possible establishment of local non-sown species. The rip-line plots, where more resources were available due to spaces between the rip-lines, initially experienced higher densities of relic weeds followed by an increase in local non-sown species densities. Hyparrhenia hirta was one of the non-sown perennials increasing in the rip-line plots. The growth of H. hirta and relic weeds was, however, controlled in the plough plots, where species densities and phytomass production of perennial sown-in species were the highest.

Induction of Polyphenol Oxidase Activity in Dormant Wild Oat (Avena fatua) Seeds and Caryopses: A Defense Response to Seed Decay Fungi	WEED SCIENCE												Persistence of the soil seed bank requires both dormancy and resistance to seed decay organisms. However, there is little or no information evaluating biochemical responses of dormant weed seeds to pathogens. Wild oat caryopses were incubated with four pathogenic fungal isolates to evaluate the response of the pathogen defense enzyme, polyphenol oxidase (PPO). Caryopsis PPO activity was induced by three Fusarium spp. isolates previously obtained from whole seeds incubated in the field whereas caryopsis PPO activity was decreased by a Pythium isolate. Fusarium avenaceum isolate F.a.1 caused the greatest PPO induction and was studied in more detail. When whole wild oat seeds were incubated on F.a.1, PPO activity was induced in seeds, hulls (lemma and palea), and caryopses. Incubation of whole seeds on F.a.1 gradually induced caryopsis PPO activity over an 8-d period, whereas incubation of caryopses on F.a.1 over a 4-d period caused a greater and more rapid induction of PPO activity. Very little PPO activity could be leached from untreated caryopses, but nearly all of the induced PPO activity in F.a.1-treated caryopses was readily leached when incubated in buffer. In Western blots, both untreated and F.a.1-treated leachates contained a similar to 57-kilodalton (kD) protein, putatively the mature and relatively inactive form of PPO. However, lower molecular weight antigenic proteins between similar to 52 and similar to 25 kD were strongly induced in F.a.1-treated caryopses, with this induction being correlated with the increase in PPO activity. We hypothesize that dormant weed seeds possess biochemical defenses against pathogens and, more specifically, that proteolysis in the presence of fungal pathogens may release an activated form of PPO from the surface of wild oat caryopses and hulls.

Patterns of seed longevity and dormancy in obligate seeding legumes of box-ironbark forests, south-eastern Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												Current fuel loads and distribution suggest that fire events are infrequent and of a low intensity in the regenerated dry sclerophyll forests of the Victorian box-ironbark ecosystem. However, many box-ironbark species possess traits consistent with fire-cued regeneration. It is unclear the degree to which human disturbance may have altered fire regimes in these forests. The infrequent and low-intensity fire regime suggested by current fuel dynamics may pose a threat to the persistence of fire-cued species. Obligate seeders such as those of the Fabaceae and Mimosaceae, common in box-ironbark understoreys, may be particularly vulnerable if inter-fire intervals exceed seed longevity. This study used seed burial trials to examine seed dormancy and longevity in five legume species to explore their capacity to regenerate under an infrequent, low-intensity fire regime. All species displayed dormancy and longevity patterns consistent with other south-east Australian legumes. Before burial, dormancy levels were high for all species (98-100%). After 3 years, storage under in situ and ex situ conditions, dormancy in Pultenaea prostrata remained at pre-burial levels with virtually no seed becoming non-dormant. Over time, some Acacia seed became non-dormant under both in situ and ex situ storage, with the pattern varying among species. Longevity also varied between species. Variation in the dormancy and longevity patterns observed in these obligate seeder legumes suggests two strategies: (i) releasing a portion of soil-stored seed from dormancy during the inter-fire period to permit inter-fire recruitment; and (ii) retaining most soil-stored seed as dormant during the inter-fire interval. Both strategies represent potential weaknesses under a long fire interval regime. The first relies on dormancy release translating to successful recruitment and requires ongoing inter-fire input into the soil seed bank. The second relies on seed longevity exceeding the inter-fire interval. Whether either is more suitable to coping with long-term infrequent fire requires long-term monitoring.

PLANT ECOLOGY												Germination and establishment of ancient forest species are bottlenecks in forest habitat restoration. We hypothesised that tree species can influence these processes on acidification sensitive soils through their effects on the soil. Seeds of seven ancient forest species were sown in soil collected in a post-agricultural forest under four different tree species, notably Acer pseudoplatanus, Alnus glutinosa, Fagus sylvatica and Populus x euramericana. Germination of four species was affected by tree species, while only Scilla non-scripta was indifferent and germination of Anemone nemorosa and Paris quadrifolia was unsuccessful. The acid intolerant Primula elatior only germinated in the soil of P. x euramericana but also the acid tolerant Lonicera periclymenum and Stellaria holostea performed best in the soil of P. x euramericana and worst in the soil of A. glutinosa. Lamium galeobdolon preferred the soil of A. pseudoplatanus. Germination of competitive seed bank species was much more successful in the soil of P. x euramericana than in soil of other tree species. From our results we deduce that tree species selection can affect germination of ancient forest species. Forest managers should be aware of the effects of tree species on their colonisation chances and favour trees with good decomposable litter especially on acidification sensitive soils.

J	French, K; Mason, TJ; Sullivan, N				French, Kris; Mason, Tanya J.; Sullivan, Natalie			Recruitment limitation of native species in invaded coastal dune communities	PLANT ECOLOGY												Recruitment limitation may limit the ability of sites to regenerate after disturbances such as weed invasion and weed management. We investigated seed bank constraints and dispersal limitation in coastal dune communities on the east coast of Australia. The ability of sites to regenerate naturally following weed removal was assessed in coastal dune communities invaded by the invasive alien, bitou bush (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subsp. rotundata). To investigate recruitment limitation, seed banks and vegetation of invaded, native, intensively managed (selective application of herbicide and some re-vegetation) and extensively managed (large-scale, non-selective herbicide application) sites were compared. We investigated the dispersal mechanisms of species in the seed bank and vegetation to determine if communities might be dispersal-limited, i.e. contain significant numbers of species with only short-distance dispersal capabilities. Species richness and composition of soil seed banks differed from the vegetation in foredunes and hinddunes. Invasion depleted seed banks further. About half of the species had short-distance dispersal mechanisms indicating the potential for dispersal limitation. Secondary weed invasion following management was evident although alien species occurred in both seed banks and vegetation. Our results indicated that coastal dune communities suffer recruitment limitation. Native, managed and invaded dune communities appear to be both seed bank and dispersal-limited although management and invasion exacerbates recruitment. Regeneration of coastal dune communities will require active reintroduction of species, particularly those with short-distance dispersal mechanisms.

J	Pouliot, R; Rochefort, L; Karofeld, E				Pouliot, Remy; Rochefort, Line; Karofeld, Edgar			Initiation of microtopography in revegetated cutover peatlands	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question: How many years are required for a gradient of microtopography to be initiated in revegetated cutover peatlands and become similar to natural bogs? Location: Newly formed Sphagnum carpets on cutover peatlands that revegetated spontaneously after site abandonment (in Estonia), or following active restoration (in Canada) and on undisturbed natural bogs nearby. Methods: Moss surface height was measured along linear transects above a local reference level (the lowest point for a given transect). Heights of at least 20 cm were associated with hummocks. Frequency distributions of surface height and principal component analyses (separately for Canada and Estonia) were conducted to follow the evolution of microtopography in revegetated sites and their similarity with those of natural peatlands. In Canada, regressions were also performed to estimate the time required for the microtopography in revegetated cutover peatlands to become similar to that found in natural bogs. Results: Only 10-30 yr were needed for microstructures comparable to those in natural bogs to develop on restored peatlands where Sphagnum diaspores have been reintroduced. However, this process may take more than a century in cutover peatlands left to revegetate spontaneously. Conclusions: In cutover peatlands with spontaneous revegetation, hummock-hollow formation starts on bare peat which lacks both plant propagules and viable seed banks, and the initiation of microstructures is probably more akin to the process that occurs naturally. Nonetheless, hummock-hollow microtopography resembling that found in natural bogs without pools appeared, in all of the examined cutover peatlands, over periods that are short in terms of peatland development time-scales. Active peatland restoration could effectively reduce the time required for initiation of microtopography by about 70 yr.

The Role of Botanic Gardens in the Science and Practice of Ecological Restoration	CONSERVATION BIOLOGY												Many of the skills and resources associated with botanic gardens and arboreta, including plant taxonomy, horticulture, and seed bank management, are fundamental to ecological restoration efforts, yet few of the world's botanic gardens are involved in the science or practice of restoration. Thus, we examined the potential role of botanic gardens in these emerging fields. We believe a reorientation of certain existing institutional strengths, such as plant-based research and knowledge transfer, would enable many more botanic gardens worldwide to provide effective science-based support to restoration efforts. We recommend botanic gardens widen research to include ecosystems as well as species, increase involvement in practical restoration projects and training practitioners, and serve as information hubs for data archiving and exchange.

USDA conservation program and practice effects on wetland ecosystem services in the Prairie Pothole Region	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Implementation of the U. S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) and Wetlands Reserve Program (WRP) has resulted in the restoration of >2 million ha of wetland and grassland habitats in the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR). Restoration of habitats through these programs provides diverse ecosystem services to society, but few investigators have evaluated the environmental benefits achieved by these programs. We describe changes in wetland processes, functions, and ecosystem services that occur when wetlands and adjacent uplands on agricultural lands are restored through Farm Bill conservation programs. At the scale of wetland catchments, projects have had positive impacts on water storage, reduction in sedimentation and nutrient loading, plant biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat. However, lack of information on the geographic location of restored catchments relative to landscape-level factors (e. g., watershed, proximity to rivers and lakes) limits interpretation of ecosystem services that operate at multiple scales such as floodwater retention, water quality improvement, and wildlife habitat suitability. Considerable opportunity exists for the USDA to incorporate important landscape factors to better target conservation practices and programs to optimize diverse ecosystem services. Restoration of hydrologic processes within wetlands (e. g., hydroperiod, water level dynamics) also requires a better understanding of the influence of conservation cover composition and structure, and management practices that occur in uplands surrounding wetlands. Although conservation programs have enhanced delivery of ecosystem services in the PPR, the use of programs to provide long-term critical ecosystem services is uncertain because when contracts (especially CRP) expire, economic incentives may favor conversion of land to crop production, rather than reenrollment. As demands for agricultural products (food, fiber, biofuel) increase, Farm Bill conservation programs will become increasingly important to ensure provisioning of ecosystem services to society, especially in agriculturally dominated landscapes. Thus, continued development and support for conservation programs legislated through the Farm Bill will require a more comprehensive understanding of wetland ecological services to better evaluate program achievements relative to conservation goals.																	1051-0761	1939-5582				APR	2011	21	3		S			S65	S81		10.1890/09-0216.1							WOS:000290660700006

Modelling evolution and management of glyphosate resistance in Amaranthus palmeri	WEED RESEARCH												A population-based model was developed to simulate the evolution of glyphosate resistance in populations of Amaranthus palmeri. Model parameters were derived from published and unpublished sources, and the model was implemented using previously established principles and methods. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the model was sensitive to variations in population size, mutation rate and seed bank dynamics. A distribution was assigned to these parameters and Monte Carlo type simulations were performed. Simulation results are therefore derived from a range of possible input parameters, enabling the risk of resistance evolution to be assessed when parameter values were unknown, uncertain or variable. In the 'worst-case' of five annual glyphosate applications in continuous glyphosate resistant cotton, evolution of glyphosate resistance was predicted in 39% of populations after 5 years and in c. 60% of populations after 10 years. These results are consistent with observations of the timescale for evolution of glyphosate resistance in A. palmeri in the field. The main drivers for glyphosate resistance evolution were selection pressure and population size, the greatest risks being associated with the largest A. palmeri populations. Risks of resistance were reduced when one of the five glyphosate applications was replaced by another mode of action with identical efficacy. However, not all glyphosate applications exerted the same selection pressure. Application of a soil residual herbicide at the time of crop sowing can provide control of A. palmeri well into the growing season and significantly reduced the rate and risk of glyphosate resistance evolution.

Seed Rain of Restored and Natural Prairie Wetlands	WETLANDS												In prairie wetland restorations, seeds may be limiting plant recolonization but this has never been quantified in the field. We evaluated the seed rain in restored and natural wetlands to determine if seed limitation constrains plant recolonization. We were particularly interested in determining whether Carex species, dominant vegetation of seasonally flooded zones, are seed limited in restorations. We quantified seed rain over two years using seed traps and compared seed rain with on-site vegetation and seed banks. The seed rain, vegetation, and seed banks of restorations were dominated by annual species rather than the target non-invasive, native perennial vegetation. Invasive perennials were not dominant in the seed rain, vegetation, or seed banks of new restorations, despite the fact that they are abundant in many older restorations. The seed rain of natural wetlands was dominated by invasive perennials, which did not reflect the prevalence of native perennial vegetation onsite. Carex species were seed limited in both wetland types. Carex species need to be sown into prairie wetland restorations to overcome dispersal limitations and to pre-empt the perennial invasive species. In addition, landscape-scale perennial invasive species management is necessary to reduce the seed supply of undesirable species to all wetlands.

J	Peters, EM; Martorell, C; Ezcurra, E				Peters, Edward M.; Martorell, Carlos; Ezcurra, Exequiel			The effects of serotiny and rainfall-cued dispersal on fitness: bet-hedging in the threatened cactus Mammillaria pectinifera	POPULATION ECOLOGY												Serotiny-the retention of seeds in the mother plant for over a year-in unpredictable environments may increase the probability that at least some seeds are dispersed during favorable periods. Propagules may be expelled when environmental cues announcing favorable conditions occur, or be gradually released into the environment. This could be a bet-hedging strategy increasing the long-term fitness by reducing interannual variability in reproduction. However, the impact of seed retention on the population dynamics of serotinous species and its contribution to fitness has been barely explored under field conditions. We assessed these issues in the threatened Mammillaria pectinifera, a small globose cactus that gets established only in exceptionally rainy years. This species expels some seeds actively during unusually rainy periods, while dispersing others passively over several years. Dynamics of the seeds in the mother plant over two very contrasting years in terms of precipitation was incorporated into a stochastic matrix model. Seed retention was found to increase significantly the probability that some of the seeds retained in any given year are dispersed within a subsequent rainy period. Active seed-expulsion raises this probability even further. As expected in bet hedgers, seed retention increased fitness in the presence of temporal variability. Active fruit expulsion did not affect fitness, but reduced demographic stochasticity. The incomplete serotiny and fruit expulsion observed is the evolutionary outcome expected for the environment and life-history attributes of the species.

Invasive potential of the winter grass Schismus barbatus during the winter season of a predominantly summer-rainfall desert in Central-Northern Monte	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Biological invasions are a major threat for natural ecosystems. Deserts are characterized by their scarce, highly variable rainfall and thus considerably susceptible to invasions, especially by annual plants that can quickly capitalize sporadic rainfall events. In this study we evaluated the potential of an invasive winter-annual species native to the Mediterranean region (Schismus barbatus) to invade a summer-rainfall desert in the Central-Northern Monte Phytogeographical Province, Argentina, where the native annual flora is mainly composed of summer species. We recorded the number of germinated seeds from soil samples collected in four seasons (during one year) coinciding with four important life-stages of Schismus (pre-germination, post-germination I and II and post-dispersal), and contrasted our results with data obtained from the literature. Almost 33,000 Schismus seeds were estimated to germinate per m(2), and about 90% percent of them germinated from samples collected in the pre-germination stage. Compared to deserts in USA and Australia, where Schismus has been a successful invader, the density of germinated seeds we observed was especially high even though the amount of rainfall for the vegetative period of Schismus was considerable lower. Our results suggest that S. barbatus has a great invasive potential in the Central-Northern Monte. The low number of annual plant populations that are able to compete for highly variable cool-season rains may be a key feature determining the invasibility of these deserts during the winter.

We tested the hypothesis that seedling emergence from soil seed banks covered with fresh cattle dung depended on seed weight, its dormancy and dung thickness. Two seed dormancy categories (low and high seed-coat impermeability to water) were obtained from a sample of hard seeds with and without scarification with sandpaper. Natural and artificial soil seed banks of Lotus tenuis were covered with 0.5, 2, 4 and 6 cm thick fresh dung pats; control seed banks were not covered. The results of this study showed that increasing dung thickness affected negatively the seedling emergence in different ways: (1) Seeds germinated under dung pats but seedling emergence was impeded with increasing dung thickness. Seedling emergence from heavy seeds was higher than from the light ones. (2) Moisture contained in the fresh dung was enough to trigger the germination of seeds on dry soil. Seedlings died because of dung desiccation. Seed dormancy prevented the germination under fresh dung. The amount of seeds recovered alive decreased with dung thickness. Seeds with high dormancy categories were more numerous than those with low dormancy categories. Cattle dung deposition on the soil seed bank of L. tenuis can negatively affect the seed survival and seedling emergence.																	0003-3847					MAR 31	2011	48	1					13	20		10.5735/085.048.0102							WOS:000289037300002

Due to frequent soil transport and vegetation disturbance, soil seed banks and seed production play an essential role for vegetation establishment in these sites. Since researchers have scarcely focussed on these traits, it was analysed in three railway and loading areas in Munich. Seed numbers in soil ranged from 1300 m(-2) on ruderalized calcareous grassland at Virginia Depot to 2800 m(-2) on the rail track beds in Steinhausen and 7600 m(-2) on ballast and calcareous gravel at Gleislager Neuaubing. The corresponding annual seed production was 17 000, 50 600 and 49 400 seeds m(-2), respectively. The seed bank of all three sites was dominated by biennial and perennial ruderals, and species naturally growing on rocky or sandy habitats. Grassland species and woody plants frequently grew in the established vegetation but scarcely occurred in the soil samples. The abundance of invasive alien species in the seed bank significantly exceeded their share in the vegetation. The seed banks also harboured endangered plants. Differences between the seed bank and the established vegetation reflect ongoing succession. While the seed bank was mainly composed of persistent seeds of early-successional plants, the established vegetation was dominated by long-lived species with transient seeds that increasingly suppress regeneration of the short-lived species. These results imply that recurring soil disturbance could re-activate the seed bank of both alien and endangered plants. Consequences for vegetation management and nature conservation are discussed.

J	Schwallier, R; Bhoopalan, V; Blackman, S				Schwallier, Rachel; Bhoopalan, Vanitha; Blackman, Sheila			The influence of seed maturation on desiccation tolerance in Phalaenopsis amabilis hybrids	SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE												The Orchidaceae contains a large number of threatened species that could benefit from seed banking. However, successful seed storage requires a greater understanding of the enigmatic seed biology of orchids. In particular, there is little documentation of the presence or timing of the maturation drying that has been shown to be critical for longevity of agricultural seeds in storage. The aims of this work were to document seed water content, germinability and desiccation tolerance as a function of maturation in developing capsules of hand-pollinated flowers of Phalaenopsis hybrids. Lengthening of capsules was complete by 50 DAP, but capsule diameter continued to increase up to a maximum at 70 DAP. Relative water content rapidly declined from 75% moisture content (fresh weight basis) at 150 DAP to 50% moisture content at 165 DAP where it remained until dehiscence. Seed germinability remained high (75-99.5%) throughout the harvesting period (90-216 DAP), but desiccation tolerance only developed 165 days after pollination. Therefore, if Phalaenopsis seeds are to be stored, we propose that their harvest should be delayed until moisture content drops below 50%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas processes important for dispersal in space are well known, knowledge of processes governing dispersal in time is still limited. Data for morphological seed traits such as size have given contradictory results for prediction of soil seed persistence or cover only a few species. There have been few experimental studies on the role of germination traits in determining soil seed persistence, while none has studied their predictive value consistently across species. Delayed germination, as well as light requirements for germination, have been suggested to contribute to the formation of persistent seed banks. Moreover, diurnally fluctuating temperatures can influence the timing of germination and are therefore linked to seed bank persistence. Methods The role of germination speed measured by T-50 (days to germination of 50% of all germinated seeds), light requirement and reaction to diurnally fluctuating temperatures in determining seed persistence in the soil was evaluated using an experimental comparative data set of 25 annual cereal weed species. Key Results It is shown that light requirements and slow germination are important features to maintain seeds ungerminated just after entering the soil, and hence influence survival of seeds in the soil. However, the detection of low diurnally fluctuating temperatures enhances soil seed bank persistence by limiting germination. Our data further suggest that the effect of diurnally fluctuating temperatures, as measured on seeds after dispersal and dry storage, is increasingly important to prevent fatal germination after longer burial periods. Conclusions These results underline the functional role of delayed germination and light for survival of seeds in the soil and hence their importance for shaping the first part of the seed decay curve. Our analyses highlight the detection of diurnally fluctuating temperatures as a third mechanism to achieve higher soil seed persistence after burial which interacts strongly with season. We therefore advocate focusing future research on mechanisms that favour soil seed persistence after longer burial times and moving from studies of morphological features to exploration of germination traits such as reaction to diurnally fluctuating temperatures.

JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The study mapped the spread of the invasive non-native shrub, Hippophae rhamnoides, on a coastal dune system in South Wales. H. rhamnoides colonies spread across the system, covering around 60.9 ha in 1996 compared to 2.4 ha in 1957. Clearance activities have since decreased the total to around 23 ha. The effects of this expansion on ground flora were assessed through comparison of species assemblages in colonised, never colonised and cleared areas. Dichotomisation presented a number of markedly different communities which correlated to their status of H. rhamnoides invasion. Colonised quadrats were overwhelmingly composed of H. rhamnoides and a few shade-tolerant species such as Galium aperine and Urtica dioica. Cleared quadrats did not support desirable dune grassland species present in never colonised sites, although those which had been cleared for the longest period may be regaining some characteristic species. Clearance work in future needs to concentrate on the complete removal of smaller H. rhamnoides patches whilst also preventing the establishment of Chamerion angustifolium and other ruderal species which in turn inhibit the development of typical dune grassland communities.

J	Wan, HW; Bai, YF; Schonbach, P; Gierus, M; Taube, F				Wan, Hongwei; Bai, Yongfei; Schoenbach, Philipp; Gierus, Martin; Taube, Friedhelm			Effects of grazing management system on plant community structure and functioning in a semiarid steppe: scaling from species to community	PLANT AND SOIL												Under the aim of searching for a more sustainable grazing management system, a mixed management system (grazing and haymaking alternate annually) was proposed and tested against traditional management system (used consistently either for grazing or haymaking) in the semiarid grassland of Inner Mongolia with a field manipulation experiment. The responses of aboveground biomass to the two grazing management systems were examined across different levels of organization (i.e., species, plant functional group, and community) and in five consecutive years from 2005 to 2009. The effects of the two systems on seed production potential of four dominant species (Leymus chinensis, Stipa grandis, Agropyron cristatum, Cleistogenes squarrosa) were also investigated. Our results demonstrate that, in the traditional system, aboveground biomass production across all the levels of organization was reduced by grazing. In mixed system, however, no significantly negative relationship between the biomass response and stocking rate was detected at all organization levels. Precipitation fluctuation had strong influence on biomass responses, and compared to the traditional system the slope of the biomass-precipitation relationship tends to be higher in the mixed system. This effect might be attributed to the more positive response of L. chinensis and A. cristatum to increase in precipitation. In the traditional system, both the ratio and the density of reproductive tillers of the grazing subplots were significantly reduced compared to the haymaking or ungrazed control plots. In the mixed system, there was no significant difference between the haymaking subplots and the ungrazed control plots, regardless of the grazing pressures imposed on the haymaking subplots in the previous growing season. Our findings suggest that the mixed system mitigates the sheep grazing-induced species shift and it tends to be more responsive to increasing precipitation as compared to the traditional system. Therefore, replacement of the traditional grazing strategy with the mixed system could provide an important contribution to sustainable land-use of the Inner Mongolia grasslands.

The coupling of recruitment and disturbance by fire in two resprouting Proteaceae species	PLANT ECOLOGY												Recruitment in plant populations is often tightly coupled to major disturbances such as fires. For species with persistent seed banks, fire-related cues may allow or enhance germination. The litter layer influences germination and may modify the impact of seed predators on seeds and seedlings. The litter layer is obviously affected by fire, providing one mechanism by which disturbance can determine recruitment. We tested the role of litter in the disturbance-recruitment coupling of two species with contrasting seed release timing after fire-Banksia serrata (canopy seed bank) and Telopea speciosissima (transient seed bank) by planting their seeds both early and late in the post-fire recruitment period (PRP) and manipulating litter density in orthogonal treatments. Vertebrate seed predators were excluded. Both species established more seedlings late in the PRP, although results were strongly influenced by very poor establishment at one site. Invertebrate seed predators consumed more T. speciosissima seeds in sites early (69.5%) than late in the PRP (51.2%), while consumption of B. serrata seeds was lower overall and comparable across sites (average 47.3%). Surprisingly, litter had very little effect on establishment and none on invertebrate seed predation, suggesting that other factors are more important. Recruitment was only loosely coupled to disturbance for the canopy seed bank species; for the transient seed bank species, the coupling was tighter but separated in time from the disturbance. Understanding both the strength and temporal aspects of the disturbance-recruitment coupling is necessary for appropriate management of plant functional diversity in fire-prone habitats.

J	Wang, LX; Macko, SA				Wang, Lixin; Macko, Stephen A.			Constrained preferences in nitrogen uptake across plant species and environments	PLANT CELL AND ENVIRONMENT												Knowledge of determining factors for nitrogen uptake preferences and how they are modified in changing environments are critical to understand ecosystem nitrogen cycling and to predict plant responses to future environmental changes. Two 15N tracer experiments utilizing a unique differential labelled nitrogen source were employed in both African savannas and greenhouse settings. The results demonstrated that nitrogen uptake preferences were constrained by the climatic conditions. As mainly indicated by root delta 15N signatures at 1:1 ammonium/nitrate ratio, in the drier environments, plants preferred nitrate and in the wetter environments they preferred ammonium. Nitrogen uptake preferences were different across different ecosystems (e.g. from drier to wetter environments) even for the same species. More significantly, our experiments showed that the plant progeny continued to exhibit the same nitrogen preference as the parent plants in the field, even when removed from their native environment and the nitrogen source was changed dramatically. The climatic constraint of nitrogen uptake preference is likely influenced by ammonium/nitrate ratios in the native habitats of the plants. The constancy in nitrogen preference has important implications in predicting the success of plant communities in their response to climate change, to seed bank use and to reforestation efforts.

However, in recent decades these ecosystems have seen rapid decline. In Belgium, more than 100 ha of calcareous grasslands have been restored from oak coppices and pine forests since the 1990s. The aim of the present study was to provide a quantitative assessment of the success of these restoration efforts, using two sets of indicators: one related to soil conditions, the other related to vascular plant communities. Soil conditions were evaluated by comparing soil samples from pre-restoration forest stands, restored grasslands (3-age classes: 2-4 years; 5-8 years, and 10-15 years) and reference grasslands. The analysis revealed no significant differences in soil N, P. and K contents between pre-restoration forests and restored and reference grasslands. We observed a decrease in the mineralization rate indicators in both pre-restoration forests and recent grassland restorations, which was resorbed in older restorations. Floristic surveys revealed that plant species composition of older restorations was most like reference grasslands. However, some differences in species composition persisted after 15 years. Moreover, a few rare species did not colonize restored grasslands despite a close seed source. Non-recolonization by a set of species expected on calcareous grasslands may be due to dispersal limitation and higher cover by native invasive grasses in restored parcels. These results were discussed in term of implications for management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Relationship Between Soil Seed Bank and Above-ground Vegetation of a Mixed-deciduous Temperate Forest in Northern Iran	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												We assessed the size and composition of the soil seed bank and above-ground vegetation in 52 releves representing a range of habitats within an old-growth, temperate deciduous forest at Hyrcanian region, northern Iran. We identified 63 taxa in the seed bank, with an average density of 4202 seeds/spores per m(2) by seedling emergence method. Hypericum androsaemum, Cardamine impatiens, and Rubus hyrcanus, with Athyrium flix- femina and Pteris cretica as two ferns, were the most abundant species in the seed bank and spore bank that made up to 92 % of the seeds/spores recorded in the soil seed bank. Totally, 107 species were recorded in the vegetation and soil seed bank of the study site, of which 33 % were common in both seed bank and vegetation and 26 % and 41 % were found only in the seed bank or in the vegetation, respectively. The dominant tree species with many woody understory species found in the above-ground vegetation were absent from the persistent soil seed bank. Jaccard's similarity coefficient revealed that the correspondence between the species in the vegetation and the same species in the seed bank were consistently low (average of 24.3%) based on presence/absence data. Yates-corrected chi(2) test showed that sites present significant differences (P<0.001) in seed bank and vegetation species composition. DCA ordination of the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank flora displays a clear pattern, with two distinct groups on the basis of the above-ground vegetation and soil seed bank floristic data. Our results explain the low similarity between soil seed bank and vegetation of the Darkola oriental beech (Fagus orientalis Lipsky) forest only to a limited extent, but confirm that most of the species of the above-ground vegetation do not depend on the persistent soil seed bank. Therefore, it may be concluded that the persistent soil seed bank is not capable of restoring the extant vegetation of the studied site.

Fire Effects on the Cheatgrass Seed Bank Pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												The generalist fungal pathogen Pyrenophora semeniperda occurs primarily in cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) seed banks, where it causes high mortality. We investigated the relationship between this pathogen and its cheatgrass host in the context of fire, asking whether burning would facilitate host escape from the pathogen or increase host vulnerability. We used a series of laboratory and field experiments to address the ability of host seeds and pathogen life stages to survive fire. First, we determined the thermal death point (TDP(50); temperature causing 50% mortality) of seeds and pathogen propagules at two time intervals using a muffle furnace. We then measured peak fire temperatures in prescribed burns at sites in Utah and Washington and quantified seed and fungal propagule survival using pre- and postburn seed bank sampling and inoculum bioassays. Finally, we investigated the survival of both seeds and pathogen after wildfires. We found that radiant heat generated by both prescribed and wild cheatgrass monoculture fires was generally not sufficient to kill either host seeds or pathogen propagules; most mortality was apparently due to direct consumption by flames. The 5-min mean TDP(50) was 164 degrees C for pathogen propagules and 148 degrees C for host seeds, indicating that the pathogen is more likely to survive fire than the seeds. Peak fire temperature at the surface in the prescribed burns averaged 130 degrees C. Fire directly consumed 85-98% of the viable seed bank, but prescribed burns and wildfires generally did not lead to dramatic reductions in pathogen inoculum loads. We conclude that the net effect of fire on this pathosystem is not large. Rapid postburn recovery of both host and associated pathogen populations is the predicted outcome. Postfire management of residual cheatgrass seed banks should be facilitated by the persistent presence of this seed bank pathogen.																	1550-7424					MAR	2011	64	2					148	157		10.2111/REM-D-10-00052.1							WOS:000288733400005						
J	Smith, P; Dickie, J; Linington, S; Probert, R; Way, M				Smith, Paul; Dickie, John; Linington, Simon; Probert, Robin; Way, Michael			Making the case for plant diversity	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment estimates that between 60,000 and 100,000 plant species are threatened with extinction-equivalent to around one-quarter of the total number of known plant species. Why should we care? There are a number of reasons. The first is that these plants may be useful to us in unknown ways. Secondly, ecology has taught us that resilience is found in diversity. Thirdly, we should be saving plant species from extinction because we can-there is no technological reason why any plant species should become extinct. Where we can't protect and manage plant diversity in situ, we should be employing ex situ conservation techniques, ranging from seed banks to habitat restoration. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment describes such interventions as 'techno-gardening'. This is not an abstract concept-it is already a reality in the majority of man-managed landscapes. In this context the perception of ex situ conservation as simply a back-up strategy for in situ conservation is mistaken. We are all involved in ex situ conservation to some degree, from cultivating our back gardens, to farming, to management of protected areas. Ex situ conservation should be seen as a complementary approach to in situ conservation and on the same spectrum. Kew's Millennium Seed Bank Partnership, comprising more than 120 plant science institutions in 50 countries, epitomizes this philosophy in action. We work actively on every seed collection we bank, finding out how useful it is and how we can grow it to enable human innovation, adaptation and resilience. Challenges remain at the policy level; for example, the need to factor-in the value of natural capital to development decision making, and better defining a role for public-sector science. At the technical level, also, there is much to do. Perhaps the greatest technical challenges relate to the restoration and management of complex, self-sustaining habitats or species assemblages. If we are to techno-garden effectively, in order to maintain ecosystem services and sustain biodiversity, then a multidisciplinary approach will be required. Many plant science institutions have recognized this and are becoming engaged increasingly in restoration activities and in situ management. Ultimately, humanity's ability to innovate and adapt is dependent on our having access to the full range of plant species and the alleles they contain.																	0960-2585					MAR	2011	21	1					1	4		10.1017/S0960258510000309							WOS:000285478000001

There is little information on this relationship in sandy habitats. We tested whether or not this pattern is retained among 141 species within a range of growth forms, from a wide range of families, in the Horqin sandy land of northern China, which belongs to the inland sand ecosystem. We collected information on seed mass, shape and persistence of these species in this region from published articles. Seed mass and shape were found to be significantly and negatively correlated to persistence in the soil in the Chinese flora, in the same way as in most other floras examined, but not in the same way as the Israeli coastal sand dune flora. The value of seed mass and shape as good predictors of persistence in the soil could be applied to the Horqin sandy land. Although many factors affect the relationship between seed mass, shape and persistence, ease of burial appears to be the main potential interpretation in the Horqin sandy land.

Few studies have attempted to demonstrate the influence of bamboos regarding the availability of soil seed bank and their implications for management. The present study aims to evaluate whether the dominance and the maintenance of the forest in the early stages of succession has been facilitated by the structure of the local seed bank within an urban fragment of Atlantic forest in Brazil. We also evaluated the forest regeneration potential of the soil seed bank under a bamboo-dominated area and a control area. A total of 5181 (units) seeds were germinated, corresponding to 81 plant species in 31 families. Miconia cf cinnanomifolia was the most abundant species in the seed bank for both forests (72.6% in control and 43.9% in bamboo-dominant). Despite the low diversity and evenness found in both areas, the seed bank in the bamboo-dominated area had higher species richness and diversity, and a heterogeneous floristic composition of shrub and tree species when compared to the control area. In both areas early-successional species of trees and shrubs dominated the seed bank (>90%). The results are discussed in terms of the regeneration ability, and it is suggested that in spite the area being a remnant with disturbed forest patches invaded by bamboos, the soil seed bank still represents an important seed source for forest regeneration.

Genetic diversity of Myanmar rice and their implementation on management methods	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Myanmar has diverse agronomic landscape and potentially preserves high level of genetic resources for important crop species. However, little study on rice landrace diversity in Myanmar has been done. Genetic and phenotypic variation to characterize rice genetic resource in Myanmar was analyzed using molecular markers as well as common garden experiments. Two populations of rice landraces, a seed-bank population maintained by seed-propagation in a genebank for several generations and an "on-farm" population collected from agricultural lands were used. A functional (cytochrome P450 related PBA) and neutral (SSR) markers were used in this study. Phenotypic characteristics of representative agronomic traits in rice, such as culm length, panicle length, number of tillers and days to heading, were measured in both populations. Multivariate analysis suggested that the seed-bank and on-farm population had different genetic bases with both functional and neutral markers. There was no significant relationship between the functional and neutral markers based on Mantel test. In addition, PCA analyses of agronomic traits showed that a variation in the seed-bank population had narrower genetic bases than the on-farm population. Genetic bias caused by 'unconscious selection' during the genebank management processes may have occurred in the landraces. The importance of the conservation on on-farm landraces of Oryza sativa and its wild relatives was proposed in order to ensure the genetic resources for further breeding and conserve biological diversity.

The data were collected in six conglomerates of one hectare, subdivided into 16 plots, in which seed rain, soil seed bank, and seedling bank were collected. The groups presented differences in the density of individuals in the seed rain and in the seedling banks. For the soil seed bank, the group G 1 differed from the groups G(2) and G(3). The seedlings bank, due to the wealth of species, may be the primary mechanism for maintaining diversity in the remnant. Seed rain was abundant and represented an expressive source of seeds to supply the seed bank and the seedling bank site and surrounding areas. The seed bank of soil did not show potential to replace the floristic richness of species in the arboreal vegetation, confirming the advanced stage of forest succession, once the seed bank is composed mainly of pioneer species				Lucio, Alessandro Dal'Col/G-3157-2019; Araujo, Maristela/O-5858-2018	Lucio, Alessandro Dal'Col/0000-0003-0761-4200; 												0103-8478					FEB	2011	41	2					251	259		10.1590/S0103-84782011000200012							WOS:000288713500012						
J	Dreber, N				Dreber, Niels			How best to quantify soil seed banks in arid rangelands of the Nama Karoo?	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Sampling design and three sample treatments prior the application of the seedling emergence method were tested in order to find the best method for seed bank quantification in arid Nama Karoo rangelands. I analyzed species composition and seed densities by contrasting undercanopy and open-matrix samples from two soil depths and by comparing the effects of cold-, heat-, and no stratification on germination rates of species in a greenhouse setting. The soil seed bank showed minimal similarity to the standing vegetation, with only 20 plant species germinated. Spatial distribution of seeds was highly heterogeneous. Nearly 90% of germinated seeds were located in 0- to 4-cm compared to >4- to 8-cm soil depth. Undercanopy seed banks contained significantly more species and seeds than open-matrix seed banks. Neither the number nor the diversity of seeds germinated differed significantly among the three treatments. Cold stratification tended to detect more species and seeds only at >4- to 8-cm soil depth. The results highlight the importance of spatial heterogeneity in the accurate evaluation of soil seed banks in the arid Nama Karoo and the importance of considering seasonal variability in the availability of readily germinable seeds. Data also suggest that sample pretreatment in germination trials may give little return for cost and effort, which emphasizes that it is more important to choose the sampling design most likely to give a representative number of seed bank species. Further studies are needed to analyze seed bank dynamics and species-specific germination requirements to promote recruitment of plant taxa underrepresented in the seed bank.																	0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB	2011	173	1-4					813	824		10.1007/s10661-010-1425-4							WOS:000287982000059	20238239

Assessing the potential for ash canopy tree replacement via current regeneration following emerald ash borer-caused mortality on southeastern Michigan landscapes	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												The emerald ash borer (EAB) has killed millions of ash trees in Michigan and at least fourteen other states since its first detection near its introduction point in metropolitan Detroit in 2002. Despite overstory ash mortality near 100% in many areas, ash seedling and saplings remain unaffected and provide the potential for ash re-establishment into the canopy of deciduous forests of the region. We examined the potential for ash re-establishment in areas of heavy mortality by measuring the status and change of ash regeneration at 45 sites across southeastern Lower Michigan in 2007 and 2009. Ash regeneration was found to be abundant in all forest types, particularly in the smallest height classes, though it was more abundant in ash species of upland forests compared to those of lowland forests. New seedlings 1-2 years old were less common than other regeneration size classes, and declined substantially between 2007 and 2009, suggesting a depletion of the ash seed bank in these forests. Regeneration density was not explained well by the presence of overstory ash prior to EAB introduction, suggesting that competitive interaction with other tree species in higher canopy strata is an important driver of ash regeneration density. Regeneration is sufficient to replenish overstory ash to pre-EAB levels in upland forests, though ecological changes caused by overstory ash mortality in lowland areas may affect local hydrology in a way that reduces opportunities for tree regeneration. Despite abundant ash regeneration, it remains unclear whether ash will recover to the overstory of forests in southeastern Michigan because of uncertainties in the future dynamics of EAB in the region.

These species are characterised by a weedy ecology enabling them to react fast to environmental changes. As a model species, we selected Capsella bursa-pastoris (Brassicaceae, Shepherd's Purse), which is annual to biennial, predominantly selfing and closely related to the genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Differentiation and adaptation in C. bursa-pastoris are shortly reviewed. Based on this knowledge, two Botanical Gardens are currently arranging long-term sites characterised by annual ploughing for the genetic monitoring of C. bursa-pastoris. Demographic parameters will be monitored as well, i.e. different life-cycle phases such as flowering, fruiting, and the soil seed bank. Furthermore, seeds of at least 20 individuals will be sampled per year. Isozyme analyses, flow cytometry, AFLPs, SNPs as well as microsatellites will be utilised to characterise changes in genetic diversity patterns over time. In general, the objective of our genetic monitoring of C. bursa-pastoris is to address the following questions: In the light of future research, our objectives are to study whether the genetic structure and diversity of C. bursa-pastoris alter over time, whether a possible invasion of ecotypes/genotypes of Sheperd's purse is traceable using genetic markers, and whether it is possible to relate variation in reproductive patterns to respective candidate genes, which may be useful for monitoring.

J	Sharrock, S; Jones, M				Sharrock, Suzanne; Jones, Meirion			Saving Europe's threatened flora: progress towards GSPC Target 8 in Europe	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The European flora is of global significance but many species are facing an ever increasing range of threats, especially the growing impacts of climate change. While various estimates have been made for the number of threatened plant species in Europe, an up-to-date European plant Red List does not presently exist. Target 8 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) calls for 60% of threatened plant species to be conserved in ex situ collections by 2010. In the absence of a European plant Red List, it is difficult to monitor progress at the regional level towards this target. To address this gap Botanic Gardens Conservation International (BGCI) has developed a consolidated list of European threatened species as a step towards a formal Red List. The database consists of national Red List data from 28 European countries and includes records for over 11,000 taxa. National Red List data were supplemented by information on the critically endangered plants of Europe provided by the Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle/European Topic Centre on Biological Diversity and the Conservatoire Botanique National de Brest. A list of regionally threatened species was extracted from the database and screened against BGCI's database of plants in cultivation in botanic gardens (PlantSearch) and ENSCONET's (European Native Seed Conservation Network) database of plants conserved in European seed banks. This analysis revealed that 42% of European threatened species are currently included in ex situ conservation programmes in Europe.																	0960-3115					FEB	2011	20	2			SI		325	333		10.1007/s10531-010-9912-z							WOS:000286984100009

Using two sizes of experimental plots (large, 1.20 m x 1.20 m; small, 0.3 m x 0.3 m), the effects of soil disturbances on vegetation dynamics and the vertical distribution of seeds were studied in one Moroccan temporary pool. Results show a very rapid regeneration of temporary wetland vegetation in disturbed plots. The speed of regeneration depends on the size of disturbance and hydrology. There was an almost complete return of vegetation to the reference state in the small disturbed plots by the end of the 1st year. This fast restoration was mainly due to seed banks, which play a key role in the resilience of pools to the different sizes of disturbances frequently generated by herbivores, but also to lateral colonization by perennials.																	1916-2790					FEB	2011	89	2					105	118		10.1139/B10-091							WOS:000287149100004

The potential role of seed banks in the recovery of dune ecosystems after removal of invasive plant species	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question How resilient is the seed bank of an invaded dune system? Is that resilience dependent on duration of invasion? How does the accumulated litter layer contribute to the soil seed bank? Location Coastal sand dunes invaded by Acacia longifolia, Portugal. Methods Seedling emergence was used to quantify and compare soil seed banks in long-invaded, recently invaded and non-invaded areas. Changes in seed banks were also compared with areas where A. longifolia and the litter layer were removed. Results Species richness, seedling density and diversity were higher in non-invaded and recently-invaded areas than in long-invaded areas. Although there was an apparent similarity between non-invaded and recently-invaded areas, analyses of species traits revealed differences. Non-invaded areas had a wider array of traits. Exotic/invasive species dominated invaded seed banks while native species dominated non-invaded seed banks. Life forms, growth forms, longevity and dispersal mode showed differences between areas, with cleared plots of long-invaded areas being apparently the most similar to non-invaded plots. Acacia longifolia seeds were most abundant in long-invaded areas, particularly where the litter layer remained. Removal of A. longifolia plus the litter had little effect on the seed bank composition of recently-invaded areas but resulted in noticeable changes in seed banks of long-invaded areas. Conclusions Long-invaded areas are less resilient and show a higher reinvasion potential, despite severe alteration of the seed banks of both areas. Seed bank studies can be a useful tool to guide management, but can give misleading results when invasion periods are protracted.

The effect of inundation and salinity on the germination of seed banks from wetlands in South Australia	AQUATIC BOTANY												Three wetlands from the Upper South East of South Australia were chosen to investigate how a past history of drought (dry since 2002, 2004 and 2005) and salinity (2800 to >20,000 mg L(-1)) influenced the response of the seed bank to two water regimes (drained and flooded) and four salinities (500, 1000,3000 and 5000 mg L(-1)). The maximum number of germinants (1270 +/- 850 m(-2)) and species richness (7 +/- 2.4) was greatest under the fresher drained treatment compared with the flooded more saline treatment under which there was no germination at one site. There were significant interactions between water regime and wetland previous history for two wetlands, but not the third which was the most saline and had experienced the longest drought. This indicated that the previous drought and salinity conditions experienced by a wetland affected seedling emergence but in the two less impacted wetlands the imposition of fresher drained conditions mitigated against these impacts. This suggests that if drought conditions continued with repeated exposure to elevated salinities the number of seeds and the species diversity of the seed banks would continue to decline.

This 10 year programme seeks to re-align Kew's work to develop plant-based solutions to the challenges of climate change. Further to the development of the Programme, Kew has undertaken a review of its science projects with relevance to mitigating the impacts of climate change on plant diversity and people. The review has allowed Kew to better understand its current strengths and weaknesses in this area in order to plan for the future. The findings of the review could be relevant for science programmes in other botanic gardens. Botanic gardens play a fundamental role in the conservation of biodiversity to mitigate climate change impacts. Knowledge and data on plant systematics, distribution and physiology is vital for modelling and monitoring the impacts of climate change, to help to identify plant species and habitats most at risk of losing their wild diversity. Kew's Millennium Seed Bank Project will safeguard 25% of plant species by 2020, while in situ projects are improving the conservation of threatened habitats. One challenge is to make such activities relevant and useful to other scientists, conservation groups and policy makers working to address climate change. However, botanic gardens must also develop working practices and projects that specifically address the challenges of climate change. Kew and a global network of partners are doing this in a variety of ways, and examples will be presented in this paper.																	0960-3115	1572-9710				FEB	2011	20	2			SI		295	307		10.1007/s10531-010-9944-4							WOS:000286984100007

Introduced populations of Genista monspessulana (French broom) are more dense and produce a greater seed rain in California, USA, than native populations in the Mediterranean Basin of Europe	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Some invasive plants perform better in their area of introduction than in their native region, and this is often attributed either to phenotypic responses and/or to adaptive evolution following exposure to new environmental conditions. Genista monspessulana (French broom) is native to Europe, but highly invasive and abundant along the Pacific Coast of the USA. In this study, the population density and age structure, plant growth and reproductive traits, and seed bank characteristics of 13 native (Mediterranean Basin) and 15 introduced (California, USA) field populations of G. monspessulana were compared. Mean population density, plant height and stem diameter were greater in introduced populations, with the latter two traits explained by a greater mean plant age. Age structure also showed a greater percentage of seedling plants in introduced populations. Fecundity was higher in introduced populations when measured in terms of mature seeds per pod, but lower when comparing seed production per plant (number of pods and mature seeds). Thus, seed rain and seed bank size was considerably higher in introduced populations. Results from this study indicate that G. monspessulana performs better in its introduced region. We hypothesize that release from natural enemies and competitors together with more favorable environmental conditions in the introduced region may explain the invasion success of G. monspessulana. As a result, an integrated management approach using introduced seed predators to suppress seed production and selected management practices to reduce seed banks may be needed for effective long-term control in California.

These ecosystems are now threatened and protection of their native plants through ex situ conservation is an urgent necessity. Cryopreservation and in vitro conservation are complementary options for securing and protecting Brazil's native plant species because their potential economic value is critically important to develop strategies that will (1) support their sustainable utilization, (2) protect against the over-exploitation of species growing in natural habitats, and (3) conserve the genetic diversity of germplasm from species of different provenances. Biotechnological approaches will help to address future economic and environmental demands placed upon already at-risk species. Conserving seed germplasm ex situ provides an additional safeguard against the risks (e. g., loss due to disease, climate change) of field conservation. Moreover, seed banks and cryobanks permit the long-term conservation of a wider genetic base; this offsets the labor and space intensive costs of conserving in the active growing state. This paper is a compilation of the current status of strategies applied for conserving Brazilian native plant species.

Biotechnology for saving rare and threatened flora in a biodiversity hotspot	IN VITRO CELLULAR & DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY-PLANT												The Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR) is a plant biodiversity hotspot with a geographically isolated and predominantly endemic flora. Known threatening processes (i.e. excessive clearing of native vegetation, soil salinity, soil erosion and chronic weed infestation) combined with uncertain but potentially deleterious environmental (climate) changes pose great challenges for conservation and restoration efforts. With a paucity of nature reserves, in situ protection of species can be problematic. For many species, ex situ conservation becomes the only viable strategy for saving species from extinction via seed banking or living collections established through vegetative propagation, or tissue (in vitro) culture methods. Development of specific in vitro protocols is necessary to successfully initiate culture lines, with considerable development of nutrient media, plant growth regulator regimes and incubation conditions required to optimise shoot regeneration and multiplication, especially with woody species of the SWAFR. In addition, integration of root induction and acclimatization stages has allowed significant improvements in speed and success of plant production of both endangered and difficult-to-propagate woody species. We contend that there is also considerable potential for expansion of alternative in vitro technologies such as somatic embryogenesis for difficult taxa to complement existing ex situ conservation and restoration strategies in biodiversity hotspots such as SWAFR.

Ecological restoration on farmland can drive beneficial functional responses in plant and invertebrate communities	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												This study contrasted the effects of the most widely implemented, low cost restoration prescriptions promoted by the English AES with more demanding and costly options on plant and invertebrate community composition, and their functional traits. In all cases these prescriptions were compared to intensive crop management. The plant community regenerating from the seed bank was species-poor, highly dynamic and had a high proportion of undesirable crop weeds. Sowing a low-cost, simple mix of tall grasses resulted in a stable community dominated by competitive grasses. Creation of these habitats resulted in negligible shifts in the functional composition of the associated invertebrate community. Sowing a diverse mix of wildflowers resulted in a stable, perennial vegetation community with both legumes and regulating hemi-parasitic plants that supported significantly more pollinator and herbivore species, as well as higher abundances of beneficial arthropod predators. There were no measured synergies when a mix of tall grass and wildflower habitats were created adjacent to each other on the same margin. The results confirm the value of ecological restoration as a potentially useful means of enhancing ecosystem function within intensive farmland systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Erschbamer, B; Mayer, R				Erschbamer, Brigitta; Mayer, Roland			Can successional species groups be discriminated based on their life history traits? A study from a glacier foreland in the Central Alps	PLANT ECOLOGY & DIVERSITY												Background: Retreating glaciers expose mineral substratum for colonisation and, as such, offer unique opportunities to study primary succession processes and life history traits of the colonisers. Aims: Results of published and unpublished case studies in a central Alpine glacier foreland were used to clarify if the species groups involved in primary succession could be discriminated by their life history traits. Methods: The case studies were carried out in the glacier foreland of the Rotmoosferner, Obergurgl site (Otztal, Tyrol, Austria) using standard methods for life history trait determination and population analyses. Results: Pioneer species could be discriminated by their low seed masses and their high seed numbers from all other successional stage species. On the moraine exposed in 1971, seed rain and seed bank composition was consistent with that of the standing vegetation. Divergent dynamics were detected on the moraines of 1923 and of 1858. The highest seedling mortality rates were recorded for the pioneer Saxifraga aizoides (86-94%); the other species studied showed survival rates of 40-76%. Conclusions: Life history traits such as seed mass, number, dispersal, persistence, and seedling recruitment govern the colonisation process and the progress of plant succession. However, seed availability appears to be the bottleneck. Succession success therefore highly depends on input of diaspores in the form of plant fragment from adjacent slopes.																	1755-0874						2011	4	4			SI		341	351		10.1080/17550874.2012.664573							WOS:000307641200005

Soil samples were taken at three soil depths (0-2, 2-5, and 5-15 cm). Germinated, dormant, and total seeds were counted. The total number of seeds was higher (p <= 0.05) under CT treatment at the two sites (CTA = 5175 seeds m(-2), NTA = 3250 seeds m(-2), CTB = 33 770 m(-2), and NTB = 22 437 seeds m(-2)). The number of viable, dormant, and germinated seeds was also higher (p <= 0.05) in CT at the two sites. The percentage of viable seeds was low with 37% (CTA), 34% (CTB), 21% (NTA), and 8% (NTB). Viable seeds of Chenopodium album L. (CHEAL) dominated in the two trials with 67% (CTA), 20% (NTA), 96% (CTB), and 77% (NTB). In a principal component analysis, PC1 separated viable seeds of weed species according to tillage and PC2 separated weed species according to sites. Poa annua L. was the most important species associated with NT followed by Cichorium intybus L., and Sonchus while Euphorbia helioscopia L. and Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P.

NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST												The spatial patterns in the seed bank were examined within a coastal sanddune system. Soil samples were collected from vegetated and bare plots in three zones, each dominated by different plant species. The total number of seeds and species diversity in the seed bank were low. There were no significant patterns in total seed number. However, there were significant differences in species composition. Seeds of Artemisia campestris (Tall Wormwood) were more abundant in vegetated plots and were found in all zones, although adults are more spatially restricted. Fruits of Cyperus grayii (Gray's Sedge) were most common where adults are found. Dominant species from the site were absent from the seed bank. Overall, composition of the seed bank does not reflect composition of the adult community.

Biodiversity in Date Palm: Molecular Markers as Indicators	DATE PALM BIOTECHNOLOGY												Date palm, a tree known only as cultivated and under domestication for thousands of years with a wide range of distinct morphological diversity, has been a target of considerable research work, including, e.g. studies on both phenotypic and genetic diversity. Most research has focused on cultivar identification, where both types of markers - phenotypic and genetic - have been utilized. A wide range of molecular markers have been applied, yet, a relatively modest amount of results has been produced. In this chapter, existing knowledge of date palm biodiversity is reviewed. The usability and potential applications of molecular markers to detect biodiversity in plant species are discussed with special emphasis on date palm. Some powerful applications of molecular markers are not utilized or are underutilized, such as DNA sequencing approaches, which will provide a complete view of different events behind the evolution of the date palm genome, and positively enhance its utilization and conservation, especially under the circumstances of climate change and the scenarios expected to follow. Applications, such as germplasm conservation and management - apart from in situ conservation and seed bank strategies - will follow successful germplasm identification and development of efficient in vitro cloning and cryopreservation protocols. A detailed assessment of the date palm biodiversity and availability of information and research results are key factors for efficient utilization of date palm germplasm.

J	Steinhardt, T; Selig, U				Steinhardt, Tim; Selig, Uwe			Influence of salinity and sediment resuspension on macrophyte germination in coastal lakes	JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY												The vegetation as well as diaspore banks were investigated in two coastal lakes on the German Baltic Coast. The distribution of vegetation and diaspores was analysed at two depths (0.5, 1.5 m) on transects. Seedling densities and germination rates of the diaspore banks were determined in a laboratory study that investigated dependencies on salinity and sediment resuspension. The vegetation study yielded five taxa in both lakes: 3 angiosperm taxa and 2 charophytes. In contrast to the poorly developed vegetation, the diaspore bank was represented by 12 taxa(-groups). The germination experiments showed five taxa. Chara contraria A. Br. ex Kutz. was the dominant species. The seedling density of this species was significantly lower at the highest salinity after sediment resuspension in one of the two lakes. The second lake showed a significantly lower seedling density at the highest salinity only for one water depth before sediment resuspension. After sediment resuspension within a salinity level, the seedling density and germination rate were as high as prior to this disturbance. Sediment resuspension can buffer the recolonisation from the sediment diaspore bank of Chara contraria after drawdown.																	1129-5767	1723-8633					2011	70	1					11	20		10.4081/jlimnol.2011.11							WOS:000294320300003

Nevertheless, it faces high deforestation rates and unsustainable land use resulting in a substantial and growing amount of degraded land, which needs to be rehabilitated for productivity and biodiversity purposes. We present the results of a reforestation experiment within a gradient of three successional phases after abandonment of pastoral use. Six native species were tested against two exotics. Furthermore, we analyzed the regeneration potential from the soil seed bank and monitored the development of the diversity of woody species in the natural succession at the different sites. Our results show that dependence on natural regeneration for forest recovery cannot be an acceptable solution for forest users, due to the low speed of recovery and the insufficient species composition of the regeneration. Planted seedlings of native species are able to cope with the harsh conditions if they are selected according to their adaptation to the environmental characteristics of the respective planting sites.

Reproductive ecology of Ochetophila trinervis in Northwest Patagonia	FUNCTIONAL PLANT BIOLOGY												Native actinorhizal species Ochetophila trinervis (Gillies ex Hook. & Arn.) Poepp. ex Miers, also known as Discaria trinervis (Kellermann et al. 2005), grows along watercourses and distant from them, along a rainfall gradient in north-west Patagonia. We studied the reproductive ecology of this species under different macro-and micro-environmental conditions, in three zones in a rainfall gradient (western, intermediate and eastern) with two sites for each one, near and distant to a watercourse (riparian and dry-land). We performed field studies and germination trials. Plant size, reproductive effort (seed abundance per branch) and seed bank size of O. trinervis, were favoured by the proximity of streams in the drier environments of the gradient. The abundance of seedlings and saplings in the field was very low, which was in agreement with a lack of germination in the field, despite the good germination capacity of seeds. Sexual reproduction of O. trinervis was affected by the low abundance of seedlings. Lower rainfall, higher temperatures and a longer growing season along the gradient favour the potential regeneration of the species. Because of its nitrogen-fixing capacity and other features, O. trinervis has potential for reclamation of eroded lands in Patagonia. Patterns of seed biology and regeneration presented in this study will aid in the use of O. trinervis in the reclamation of disturbed lands.																	1445-4408						2011	38	8-9					720	727		10.1071/FP11010							WOS:000293976500013

Effect of the gaseous environment and water content on seed viability of four Brassicaceae species after 36 years storage	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Seeds of four species of Brassicaceae (Brassica oleracea, Diplotaxis virgata, Sinapis alba and Sisymbrium irio) were stored for 36 years in the UPM (Universidad Politecnica de Madrid) seed bank at temperatures between -5 degrees C and -10 degrees C, enclosed in flame sealed vials. For each species, four different storage conditions were tested. Seeds were either desiccated with silica gel (approximately 1-3% water content, fresh weight basis) or held under laboratory conditions (6.7-9.3% water content). In half of the tubes containing seeds of each moisture content, the air was partially substituted by CO(2) before closing the vials. After the storage period seeds were set to germinate. Some persistent (or created during storage) dormancy was observed in all treatments of D. virgata and S. irio, but only in ultra-dried seeds of S. alba. CO(2)-enriched atmosphere improved longevity for all four species studied, especially in those seeds that had not been desiccated with silica gel.				Tejeda, Guzman/E-5806-2016; Gonzalez-Benito, M.

J	Diggory, ZE; Parker, VT				Diggory, Zooey E.; Parker, V. Thomas			Seed Supply and Revegetation Dynamics at Restored Tidal Marshes, Napa River, California	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Tidal marsh restoration largely depends on natural seed rain to revegetate restored sites, but often little is known about the abundance and composition of the seed rain, or how it is influenced by individual species' dispersal or recruitment limitations. We monitored vegetation, seed rain, seed bank, and physical conditions at three restored and one reference tidal marsh to evaluate the seed rain's ability to revegetate restored sites, and the relative role of seed dispersal in revegetation patterns. The vegetation at the reference site is significantly more species-rich than the restored sites, while the composition of their seed rain is similar. Species absent from the vegetation at restored sites are missing from the seed rain at all sites, suggesting that these species are dispersal limited. This does not preclude recruitment limitations for these species, however, as several key physical conditions differ between restored sites and the reference site, which experiences less time inundated and higher summer soil salinity. Although a large amount of the seed rain is washed out of the marsh before becoming incorporated into the seed bank, total seed input is high at restored sites, suggesting that the natural seed supply is adequate to fully revegetate restored marshes, although with lower species richness than reference sites. The strongest influences on a species abundance in the seed rain are its frequency in the vegetation and seed production, suggesting that fecund species that colonize a site early will continue to dominate the seed rain and vegetation development in restored sites.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				JAN	2011	19				SI		121	130		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00636.x							WOS:000285968100014

For this purpose a total of 52 releves was established in two associations and two subassociations of the beech forests, and six soil samples (20 x 20 cm square and to a depth of 10 cm) were collected in each releve in mid-spring, after the germination season had ended. Soil seed bank was investigated using the seedling emergence method. A total of 63 species, 57 genera and 36 families was represented in the persistent soil seed bank of the forest communities. The seed bank contained 28 species not found as adult plants in the vegetation, but these were mostly early successional species. Size of the seed bank ranged from 3740 to 4676 individuals m(-2) in the Rusco hyrcani-Fagetum orientalis and Danae racemosae-Fagetum orientalis associations, respectively. Species composition of seed banks and aboveground vegetation had low similarity with an average of 24.3% in the four plant communities, because only 38% of the species were the same in the vegetation and the seed banks. Most seeds in the seed bank were from early successional species, and the only tree with a large persistent seed bank was the fast-growing pioneer Alnus subcordata. DCA ordination also demonstrated low similarity between soil seed bank and vegetation. The soil seed banks of the four beech communities did not differ significantly in size, composition, diversity and uniformity. Although above ground vegetation in the four community types is floristically distinct, there is considerable overlap among the soil seed banks because they contain in a similar way early successional species. Further, the absence of typical forest species in the soil seed bank indicates that restoration of forest tree species cannot rely on the soil seed bank. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

Accelerated aging seeds treated for 0-14 days exhibited loss of germinability in the longest aging treated seeds (11%, 14 days) compared to a good performance of 52% for control (0 day) seeds. Leachate electrical conductivity (EC) increase had strong negative correlation with seed vigor (-0.9). Magnesium ion concentration in electrolyte leakage from artificial aged seeds showed positive correlation (r = 0.94, P < 0.01). The ratios of inorganic ions showed that K+/Mg2+, Ca2+/Mg2+, and Na+/Mg2+ were inversely correlated with germination (-0.93, -0.82, and -0.91, respectively). Increases in starch and total soluble sugar content in aged seeds were associated with a decrease in seed vigor. In conclusion, EC, magnesium ion concentration, K+/Mg2+, Ca2+/Mg2+, and Na+/Mg2+ ratios and starch and total soluble sugar content could provide a sensitive and accurate index for the assessment of U. parvifolia seed vigor.																	0169-4286	1573-5095				JAN	2011	41	1					3	11		10.1007/s11056-010-9210-3							WOS:000290612400002

Intercropping of oat and field pea in Alaska: An alternative approach to quality forage production and weed control	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE												Intercropping of legumes with non-legumes is an ancient crop production method used to improve quality and dry matter (DM) yields of forage and grain, and to control weeds. However, there is little information regarding intercropping at high latitudes. The objectives of this field study were to evaluate performance of (1) sole cropped oat (Avena sativa L.) (cultivars Toral and Calibre) and pea (Pisum sativum L.) (cultivars Carneval and Orb) and their intercrop combinations, and (2) inter- and sole-crop responses to weeds. The different cropping systems were studied with different weed treatments (weed-free all season long, weed-free until flowering, and left weedy all season long). In general intercrops of oat and pea produced DM (forage) and grain yields similar to sole oat crops and higher than sole pea crops although the difference was not statistically significant. Furthermore, forage quality [ crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF)] was improved by intercropping. Most of the variables measured were unaffected by weed treatments, however weed DM was generally lower in sole oat and oat-pea intercropping than sole pea cropping systems. More than 80% of the weed DM was from common lamb's quarters (Chenopodium album L.). The CP of this weed was higher than oat and pea, and ADF and NDF were equivalent to the sole cropped oat. Thus, including weeds as part of the forage is possible. However, if crops are grown for grain, weeds are likely to produce large numbers of seeds that would enter the seed bank. Thus, pea-oat intercrops show potential as an alternative and sustainable approach for optimum yield and high quality forage and weed control under Alaskan subarctic conditions.																	0906-4710						2011	61	3					235	244		10.1080/09064711003745508							WOS:000289346100007

Temporary cropping in semi-arid shrublands increases native perennial grasses	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Thickening of native shrubs is a major problem in many 'semi-arid woodlands' as significant increase in shrub density is often negatively correlated with herbaceous vegetation and leads to reduced pasture production and soil erosion. This project aimed to test the hypothesis that temporary cropping (up to three crops in 15 years) consistently increases the density of native perennial grasses following the removal of shrubs. A total of 30 paddocks that had been cropped during the last 20 years were randomly selected using a satellite-based database that documented annual clearing and cropping history from 1987 to 2003. Paddocks were classified into four types based on clearing and cropping history and grazing management - not cleared (shrubs), regrowth (re-invaded by shrubs), set stocked (cropped and grazed), light/rotationally grazed (cropped and grazed). The responses of vegetation and soil (chemical and physical) properties to clearing and cropping were evaluated. Results indicated that ground cover, native perennial grass cover and standing dry matter were highest under light/rotationally grazed conditions. The shrub state represents a stable state within the Cobar pediplain brought about due to land-use change in the form of overgrazing and/or the removal of fire from the system. An alternative stable state was achieved as a result of disturbance in the form of clearing, cropping and grazing management thereby directly altering the shrub population. The resilience of this state is largely dependent on the grazing management system used and on the prevention of shrub from re-establishing while failure to control shrubs could lead to the re-emergence of the Shrub State. We conclude that native grasslands do regenerate following cropping after removal of shrubs. The importance of grazing management for restoring perennial ground cover following removal of shrubs and temporary cropping has been clearly demonstrated by the study.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2011	33	1					67	78		10.1071/RJ10022							WOS:000288702100007

The successful pre-germination seed treatments are needed in order to support reintroduction programs and conservation of endangered species. This study encompassed seed survival at different depths and removal of M. schiedeana. Also we tested the efficacy of several pre-germinative treatments of M schiedeana seeds. Seeds of M schiedeana survived for two years in the soil, suggesting the ability to form a persistent seed bank. The viability of seeds, buried for two years in the soil at different depths (soil surface, 5, 10 and 15 cm), did not differ significantly (P>0.05). With exposure to vertebrates, removal of seeds was 100% during the first month, whereas the exclusion of vertebrates resulted in removal of only 32% of seeds after one year (chi(2) = 13.75, P<0.05). The most successful pre-germinative treatments were 1) "48 h" treatment, where mechanically scarified seeds were placed in a layer of wet, sterilized river sand, incubated at 4-10 degrees C for 13 days and subsequently soaked with sterile water for 48 h soaking seeds in water at room temperature (18 +/- 2 degrees C), and 2) the "30 degrees C" treatment, where mechanically scarified seeds placed in warm water (30 degrees C) until the water had cooled to room temperature, and then soaked in sterile water for 48 h (both 84% germination). However, the "30 degrees C" treatment had longer period of germination (35 +/- 2.3 days).																	1459-0255	1459-0263				JAN	2011	9	1					604	608									WOS:000288779300119

The evaluation of the number of seeds and seedling emergence was accomplish at the Laboratory of Seeds Analysis of the Faculdade de Agronomia "Eliseu Maciel" (UFPEL). It was found that both as the crop as the natural seeding allow large quantities of seeds in the soil for the upper circa suitable for planting. The harvest area is heterogeneous in the number of seeds in soil and plants in the circa.

Preburn History and Seasonal Burning Effects on the Soil Seed Bank in the Fescue Prairie	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Fescue Prairie is one of the most threatened ecosystems in Canada, and burning is essential for conserving remnants of this grassland. Burning is a key process in the natural disturbance regime, but its effect on the soil seed bank in Fescue Prairie is poorly understood. We tested the hypotheses that (1) preburn history influences the density and composition of seedlings emerging from the soil seed bank, and (2) burning in different seasons reduces densities and changes the composition of seedlings emerging from soil seed banks compared with non-burned controls in Fescue Prairie. Seedling emergence from seed banks was studied for 5 y in non-burned controls and following burning before, during or after the growing season on sites with different preburn histories (sites burned two times or sites burned >90 y before this study). Preburn history had no effect (P >= 0.14) on the density of native graminoids, native forbs, non-native species, total species richness (R) and diversity (H') of species emerging. Burning during or after the growing season reduced H' of emergent seedlings by 13% compared with burning before the growing season (P = 0.02). Total seedling densities, densities of graminoids and forbs, R and H' all varied significantly (P <= 0.01) among years. Non-metric multidimensional scaling indicated species composition for seedlings emerging from seed banks correlated with preburn history, years after applying seasonal burning treatments, and soil water content in plant communities but not with season of burning. After burning remnant Fescue Prairies, inter-annual variation in the densities, R and H' of seedlings emerging from seed banks usually overshadows preburn history and seasonal burning effects on emergent seedlings; however, species composition changes with preburn history, soil water content and years after burning.																	0003-0031					JAN	2011	165	1					74	90		10.1674/0003-0031-165.1.74							WOS:000286967000006

Performance of Vegetation in Reclaimed Slopes Affected by Soil Erosion	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Soil erosion in reclaimed mines may affect plant colonization and performance, and may compromise restoration success; however, the magnitude of this effect has seldom been quantified. We monitored the dynamics of vegetation (seed bank density, seedling emergence, plant mortality, and seed production) during a growing season (2003-2004) in three constructed slopes with differing past erosion rates. The slopes are located in the Utrillas coalfield in Spain, which experiences a Mediterranean-continental climate. In the most eroded slope, soil water availability was lower-especially in the interrill areas-and seedling emergence rate, plant survival, and seed production were also significantly lower than on the less eroded slopes. We found that vegetation recovery is dramatically constrained when rill erosion rate is 17 t ha(-1) yr(-1) and plant cover is 30%, but this effect disappears when plant cover is higher than 60%. Soil erosion in constructed slopes appears to inhibit natural plant colonization processes by increasing runoff water loss over the long-term. Thus, when rill erosion networks develop, human intervention would be needed to minimize the loss of water and facilitate vegetation colonization.				de las Heras, Mariano Moreno/M-2542-2013	de las Heras, Mariano Moreno/0000-0003-3366-5060												1061-2971	1526-100X				JAN	2011	19	1					35	44		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00546.x							WOS:000286024400005

We experimentally tested for seed and microsite limitations on roadslopes by assessing the effects of seed addition and habitat suitability upon plant cover and species richness. The relative contributions of topsoil seed bank, seed rain, and hydroseeding with standard or native seed mixtures were analyzed in relation to soil texture, fertility, and stability. In order to increase applicability, this research was fitted into the actual construction design and schedule of a highway in central Spain, which resulted in topsoil of varying quality, steep roadcuts and embankments (34 degrees), and out-of-season hydroseedings. During the first 2 years following roadslope construction, there was an uneven but sustained increase in plant cover and species richness. Topsoil spread on embankments led to greater plant cover in a shorter time and to lower sedimentation rates at slope bases. The topsoil seed bank was extremely poor. Hydroseeding invariably failed, regardless of seed mixture and roadslope type. The seed rain provided seven times more seeds than hydroseedings, and was correlated with the distance to vegetation patches. Recruitment, however, was limited by microsite suitability, as the initial soil content in nitrate, total nitrogen, and organic matter explained up to 80% of variation in plant cover. In conclusion, when revegetation was performed outside the optimal season due to schedule constraints, measures aimed at overcoming microsite limitation were more cost-effective and enhanced roadside carrying capacity for local species.

Resilience, Restoration, and Riparian Ecosystems: Case Study of a Dry land, Urban River	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Resilient systems can absorb disturbance and persist despite variability as long as the capacity of the system to adapt is not exceeded. Riparian plant communities of dryland alluvial rivers are expected to be naturally resilient systems because they persist in the highly variable flood-plain. River modification has altered the flow regime on many dryland rivers, in some cases exceeding the adaptive capacity of the riparian vegetation, but these changes may be readily reversible. The Salt River in Phoenix, Arizona has been impounded, dewatered, channelized, but also rewatered with urban effluent and storm drain runoff. To determine whether riparian vegetation is resilient to these various perturbations, paired comparisons were made in the vegetation and seed bank between a non-diverted reference reach, a diverted reach, and a re-watered urban reach. In the diverted reach, composition had shifted to that of a stress tolerant xeroriparian shrubland with low diversity in both the seed bank and extant vegetation. Most surprisingly, few differences were observed in the composition and structure of the vegetation and soil seed banks between the reference reach and the urban reach, particularly in the wet patches, suggesting that hydric riparian plant communities have the capacity to adapt to these modified conditions. These results provide support for a process-oriented approach to restoration on the Salt River and other urban dryland rivers using patches of persisting vegetation as models for achievable restoration targets.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				JAN	2011	19	1					101	111		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2009.00531.x							WOS:000286024400012

Influence of Changing Water Sources and Mineral Chemistry on the Everglades Ecosystem	CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Human influences during the previous century increased mineral inputs to the Florida Everglades by changing the sources and chemistry of surface inflows. Biogeochemical responses to this enrichment include changes in the availability of key limiting nutrients such as P, the potential for increased turnover of nutrient pools due to accelerated plant decomposition, and increased rates of mercury methylation associated with sulfate enrichment. Mineral enrichment has also been linked to the loss of sensitive macrophyte species, although dominant Everglades species appear tolerant of a broad range of mineral chemistry. Shifts in periphyton community composition and function provide an especially sensitive indicator of mineral enrichment. Understanding the influence of mineral chemistry on Everglades processes and biota may improve predictions of ecosystem responses to ongoing hydrologic restoration efforts and provide guidelines for protecting remaining mineral-poor areas of this peatland.

We tested the method to detect important weeds in Argentina and Minnesota, and determined the minimum number of solaria required to predict the presence of emerged weed seedlings in the forthcoming growing season. Three experiments were performed in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina, and one in Minnesota. Solaria were placed in fields with different previous crops and soil management: no tillage (two fields) and conventional tillage (two fields). Preceding crops were corn (one field), wheat (one field), and double-cropped wheat/soybean (two fields). After weeds were enumerated, solaria were removed, sunflower (one field) and soybean (three fields) were planted, and weeds later assessed in each crop. Results indicate that one solarium per 1.9 ha can detect common lambsquarters with 95% confidence within the next summer crop. For other species, one solarium per 4.2, 1.2, 1.0, and 1.8 to 2.7 ha (depending upon field site) for large crabgrass, prostrate knotweed, wild buckwheat, and green foxtail, respectively, was required. The low cost and simplicity of assessment make this technique more suitable than that of soil seed-bank samples to predict weed emergence. The number of solaria required to forecast weed infestation levels confidently is sufficiently low that their use may be justified, especially in small fields of high-value crops.

Edward; Mallory-Smith, Carol			Effect of Fall Tillage and Cover Crop Strategies on Wild-Proso Millet (Panicum miliaceum) Emergence and Interference in Snap Beans	WEED TECHNOLOGY												Direct-seeding of cover crops is often promoted to reduce potential soil loss during the winter, enhance soil fertility, and reduce energy use and equipment traffic on fields. The impact of direct-seeding of cover crops on wild-proso millet seedling emergence in subsequent crops is unknown. In this study, a pulse chase experiment determined the effect of five fall soil management strategies, two spring primary tillage levels, and two herbicide programs on wild-proso millet emergence in a subsequent crop of snap beans. Wild-proso millet seeds were sown following sweet corn harvest in two commercial production fields to simulate seed rain at a density of 500 and 1,000 seeds m(-2) in the fall of 2004 and 2005, respectively. The experimental design was a split split plot. Five fall treatments were applied to main plots and included direct drilling of cover crops, conventionally tilled and drilled cover crops, a winter fallow treatment, and two additional treatments that were direct-drilled and conventionally tilled in the fall but that were not seeded with cover crops to separate the effects of tillage and cover crops on wild-proso millet emergence. Main plots were split in the spring and snap beans planted without primary tillage or conventionally planted after the soil was tilled. Tillage and cover crop treatments applied in the fall influenced emergence in the spring but with slightly different outcomes at the two sites. Direct drilling without a cover crop produced more wild-proso millet seedlings in snap beans than the winter fallow plot; tillage before cover crop planting in the fall produced recruitment levels less than or equal to densities in the winter fallow plots, with one exception. At one site, cover crops increased emergence compared to plots without cover crops. Spring tillage did not alter the affect of the five fall management treatments on wild-proso millet emergence. Direct-seeding of cover crops should be done with equipment or methods that minimize soil disturbance to prevent movement of wild-proso millet seeds into protected and favorable zones of emergence in the soil.																	0890-037X	1550-2740				JAN-MAR	2011	25	1					119	126		10.1614/WT-D-10-00090.1							WOS:000287679500020

Harvest Loss and Seed Bank Longevity of Flax (Linum usitatissimum) Implications for Seed-Mediated Gene Flow	WEED SCIENCE												Flax is a minor oilseed crop in Canada largely exported to the European Union for use as a source of industrial oil and feed ingredient. While flax could be genetically engineered (GE) to enhance nutritional value, the adoption of transgenic technologies threatens conventional flax market acceptability. Harvest seed loss of GE crops and the persistence of GE crop volunteers in the seed bank are major factors influencing transgene persistence. Ten commercial fields in Alberta, Canada, were sampled after harvesting conventional flax in 2006 and 2007, and flax seed density and viability were determined. Additionally, artificial seed banks were established at two locations in Alberta in 2005 and 2006 to quantify persistence of five conventional flax cultivars with variability in seed coat color (yellow or brown) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3(cis Delta 9,13,15)) content (3 to 55%) at three soil depths (0, 3, or 10 cm). Harvest methods influenced seed loss and distribution, > 10-fold more seed was distributed beneath windrows than between them. Direct harvested fields had more uniform seed distribution but generally higher seed losses. The maximum yield loss was 44 kg ha(-1) or 2.3% of the estimated crop yield. Seed loss and the viability of flax seed were significantly influenced by year, presumably because weather conditions prior to harvest influenced the timing and type of harvest operations. In artificial seed bank studies, seed coat color or ALA content did not influence persistence. Flax seed viability rapidly declined in the year following burial with < 1% remaining midsummer in the year following burial but there were significant differences between years. In three of four locations, there was a trend of longer seed persistence at the deepest burial depth (10 cm). The current study predicts that seed-mediated gene flow may be a significant factor in transgene persistence and a source of adventitious presence.

Cover Crops and Disturbance Influence Activity-Density of Weed Seed Predators Amara aenea and Harpalus pensylvanicus (Coleoptera: Carabidae)	WEED SCIENCE												The activity-density of Amara aenea (DeGeer) and Harpalus pensylvanicus (DeGeer) (Coleoptera: Carabidae) was monitored in an experiment that compared five management treatments representing a range of disturbance frequencies, crops, and aboveground biomass production. In 2004 and 2005, three treatments comprised of multiple summer cover crops were compared to bare fallow and soybean, the latter of which used mechanical cultivation to manage weeds. In 2005 weed seed predation was assessed from June to September in two of the treatments (bare fallow and oat-pea/rye-hairy vetch). Beetle activity-density varied with treatment, time of sampling, and year. In 2004 peak activity-density of A. aenea was highest in the mustard/buckwheat/canola, but there was no difference in H. pensylvanicus activity-density. In 2005 activity-density of H. pensylvanicus was higher in oat-pea/rye-hairy vetch than in soybean treatment. Seed predation rates were relatively consistent across treatments, averaging between 38 and 63%. In fallow and oat-pea/rye-hairy vetch, H. pensylvanicus activity-density accounted for 29 and 33% of the variation in seed predation, respectively. Our findings suggest cover crops have a positive effect on the activity-density of A. aenea and H. pensylvanicus and that disturbance negatively influences their activity-density in the absence of cover crops.

The Selective Memory of Weed Seedbanks after 18 Years of Conservation Tillage	WEED SCIENCE												A conservation tillage study provided the opportunity to test whether tillage effects on the germinable weed seedbank would be consistent across different crop rotations and to investigate the potential residual effects of herbicide treatments terminated 12 yr earlier. Our objective was to measure the effects of tillage (moldboard plow [MP] vs. chisel plow [CP] vs. no-till [NT]), crop rotation (2-yr barley red clover followed by 4-yr barley canola wheat soybean rotation, compared to a cereal monoculture), and of a prior weed management factor (three intensity levels of herbicide use) on the density, diversity, and community structure of weed seedbanks. Species richness, evenness (Shannon's E), and diversity (Shannon's H') of spring seedbanks varied little across treatments and over time. Total seedbank density generally increased as tillage was reduced, with some variations due to weed management in 1993 and crop rotation in 2006. Crop rotations generally had smaller seedbanks with fewer species than the monoculture. In 1993, seedbanks with minimum weed management were twice as dense as those with intensive or moderate weed management (approximately 6,000 vs. 3,000 seed m(-2)). By 2006, seed density averaged 6,838 seed m(-2) across intensive and moderate weed management regardless of tillage, but was nearly twice as large in NT (12,188 seed m(-2)) compared to MP (4,770 seed m(-2)) and CP (7,117 seed m(-2)) with minimum weed management (LSD0.005 = 4488). Species with abundant seedbanks responded differently to treatments. Barnyardgrass and green foxtail had larger seedbanks in the monoculture than in the rotation. Common lambsquarters and pigweed species had large seedbanks in tilled treatments in the rotation, whereas yellow foxtail and field pennycress contributed to the large seedbanks observed in NT treatments. The latter two species were also associated with residual effects of weed management treatments (terminated 12 yr earlier) in NT. The differential seedbank response of weed species, attributed in part to contrasting weed emergence patterns and agronomic practice effects on seed rain, explained some of the weak treatment effects observed for total seedbank density and diversity. The large weed seedbanks observed in NT plots after 18 yr confirms the importance of seed rain and seedbank management for the sustainability of NT systems.																	0043-1745	1550-2759				JAN-MAR	2011	59	1					98	106		10.1614/WS-D-10-00092.1							WOS:000286716700015

Prediction that seeds of woody species replace those of herbaceous species during succession was tested and mechanisms of species replacement (facilitation, tolerance, inhibition) were assessed. Four successional categories (three sites each) were considered: pasture (0-1 y since abandonment), early (3-5 y), intermediate (10-12 y), and old-growth forest. At the end of the dry season, 20 cylindrical soil samples (10 cm diameter, 15 cm depth) were randomly obtained within a 20 x 50-m plot in each site. Seeds >= 1 mm were counted and identified. Overall, 2941 seeds and 102 morphospecies (52 taxonomically identified) were recorded. Seed bank density reduced, species diversity remained fairly constant and seeds of herbaceous species were replaced by those of woody species over the chronosequence. A clear species-by-species replacement pattern was detected, as expected under a mechanism of succession by facilitation. Twelve years after abandonment, a diverse seed bank of woody species did exist, indicating a fast recovery of the tropical-dry-forest regenerative potential; nonetheless, the structure and composition of the seed bank was still different from that in the old-growth forest.

Coupled Bayesian Networks and recursive partitioning method for wetland ecological modelling	19TH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS ON MODELLING AND SIMULATION (MODSIM2011)					MSSANZ 19th Biennial Congress on Modelling and Simulation (MODSIM)	DEC 12-16, 2011	Perth, AUSTRALIA	CSIRO, Australian Govt, Bur Meteorol, Per Convent & Exhibit Ctr, Perth Convent Bur, Curtin Univ, Australian Math Soc, Australian & New Zealand Ind & Appl Math, Australian Math Sci Inst, Maralte Publishers, Econ Soc Australian, HEMA Consulting, Simulat Australia, Stat Soc Australia Inc, Modelling & Simulat Soc Australia & New Zealand Inc, Int Assoc Math & Comp Simulat				Bayesian Networks (BNs) are increasingly recognised as a useful tool for ecological modelling due to their ability to incorporate a broad range of data types and explicit representation of uncertainty through the use of probabilities. They allow considerable flexibility with respect to the detail and focus of the models allowing conceptually simple habitat condition models or more complex mechanistic representation of ecological response. However, BN outputs are sensitive to the model structure, particularly the selection and linking of variables and how the states are defined for each variable. In this paper, we use recursive partitioning to inform the configuration of the structure of BNs, used for ecological response modelling. The Narran Lakes Ecosystem is a nationally important floodplain wetland complex considered at risk. In 2005, a mesocosm experiment was conducted as part of the Narran Lake Ecosystem Project to investigate the seedbanks of ephemeral plant communities in response to a range of flood scenarios. From that data and existing literature, a conceptual model describing the major hydrological influences on the ephemeral herbfields was generated. BN ecological response models were then constructed using these data. The models were developed using information generated from recursive partitioning (regression tree and random forests) and BN learning approaches (Figure 1). The models have been incorporated into an environmental flow Decision Support System (DSS), IBIS DSS. The BN model is linked to a hydrological model of the Narran Lakes allowing the modelling of ecological response to flow series. Recursive partitioning analyses of biophysical and ecological data informed the development of BNs in two ways. Firstly, random forests analyses were used to identify important predictor variables: those variables that, statistically, best explain the ecological responses. Secondly, thresholds were identified using decision tree analysis to reduce subjectivity in the discretisation of variables in the BNs. Using the coupled BNs and recursive partitioning method improved the rigour and certainties associated with state discretisation, and allowed us to refine the choice of model variables, while maintaining the advantages associated with applying BNs within the DSS.

Species composition and seed bank density were estimated using the seedling emergence method. Seedling emergence was observed over two vegetation seasons. Research demonstrated that: 1) the species abundance of the seed banks depends on canopy cover (A, B approx. 50 species; C, D approx. 70 species); 2) the floristical similarity (Sorensen's index) of the seed bank and ground vegetation is higher in the undisturbed patch D (0.50) than in disturbed patches (0.30-0.35); 3) species diversity in plots A, B, C, D (H'=12.5; 13.4; 15.5; 16.9) and seed bank density per m(2) (432.5; 958.0; 1486.5; 2268.0) are negatively correlated with the degree of patch shading; 4) the average weight of diaspores in the seed banks of shady plots is lower (A, B approx. 0.003 g) than that of sunny plots (C, D approx. 0.08 g); 5) the share of long-lived diaspores increases in patches after logging.

Seed banks of 40-50-year-old fallow lands are dominated by Calluna vulgaris, while the seed bank of the old fresh coniferous forest is dominated by dicotyledonous perennials and grasses; (iii) within the first 50 years of succession the persistence of seed banks measured by the Longevity Index increases gradually.

Short-term response of the encroacher shrub Seriphium plumosum to fire	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE												Quantification of the short-term impact of burning in terms of the encroacher shrub Seriphium plumosum and grass tuft mortality, seed germination of the shrub (field and seed bank), aboveground phytomass production, plant density and basal cover of the grass sward was conducted in semiarid grassland following an accidental fire. These variables were determined along a terrain morphological unit where S. plumosum density increased with altitude. On average 57% of S. plumosum seedlings were killed by fire, but fire had no significant (P > 0.05) influence on the mortality of mature shrubs. Fire significantly (P <= 0.01) stimulated seedling emergence of S. plumosum, to such an extent that an average of 510 seedlings ha(-1) occurred on the foot slope, while only 9.14 seedlings ha(-1) emerged in the unburnt treatment. Seedling emergence showed greater association with protection from direct sunlight and seedlings emerged not closer than 281 mm from the nearest leaves (canopy) of a mature S. plumosum shrub. The aboveground phytomass production of the unburnt grass sward was nearly double that of the burnt areas over the first season following the fire.

Density-Structured Models for Plant Population Dynamics	AMERICAN NATURALIST												Density-structured models are structured population models in which the state variable is the proportion of populations or sites in a small number of discrete density states. Although such models have rarely been used, they have the advantage that they are straightforward to parameterize, make few assumptions about population dynamics, and permit rapid data collection using coarse density assessment. In this article, we highlight their use in relating population dynamics to environmental variation and their robustness to measurement error. We show that density-structured models are able to accurately represent population dynamics under a wide range of conditions. We look at the effects of including a persistent seed-bank and describe numerical approximations for the mean and variance of population size. For simulated data, we determine the extent to which the underlying continuous process may be inferred from density-structured data. Finally, we discuss issues of parameter estimation and applications for which these types of models may be useful.

POLLEN AND SEED PRODUCTION	ANNALS OF AGRICULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE												Ambrosia artemisiifolia L (common ragweed) is a familiar roadside weed in southern Quebec (Canada) that produces large amounts of airborne pollen responsible for multiple rhino-conjunctivitis (hay fever) cases. As roadside weeds are increasingly controlled by mowing alone, the effect of a mowing treatment on pollen production was evaluated. Ambrosia artemisiifolia plants were grown in a greenhouse at 4 densities (1, 3, 6 and 12 plants per 314 cm(2) pot) and either left intact or mowed (10 cm from the ground) when the plants reached 25 cm in height, i.e. twice during the life cycle of this annual plant. Pollen production per male inflorescence was collected in open-top bags and counted. Inflorescence mass, length, location on the plant and date of anthesis onset was noted. Above-ground plant biomass and seed production was also evaluated. Mowed plants produced less pollen per unit of inflorescence length than intact plants. Pollen production per plant was reduced by a factor of 8.84 by the double mowing treatment, while viable seed production per plant was reduced by a factor of 4.66, irrespective of density. Mowing twice has the potential to reduce airborne pollen loads but Ambrosia artemisiifolia seed banks are unlikely to be depleted by this management strategy.																	1232-1966	1898-2263					2011	18	1					55	62									WOS:000292436800009	21736270

No effect of transgene and strong wild parent effects on seed dormancy in crop-wild hybrids of rice: implications for transgene persistence in wild populations	ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY												Soil seed banks act as a gene pool for local plant species and, as such, can buffer local populations, especially those experiencing challenging environmental conditions. Seed dormancy has important implications to dynamics of soil seed banks. Therefore, estimating the seed dormancy of transgenic crop-wild hybrids could shed light on the persistence of transgenes in wild-plant soil seed banks. Individuals from eight populations of wild rice Oryza rufipogon were crossed with those of three insect-resistant transgenic rice lines. Selfed (F2-F4) and backcrossed populations (BC1, BC1F2 and BC1F3) were then made from the hybrids. Seed germination was tested under three treatments: (a) normal; (b) overwintering in soil; and (c) one-week heat-shocking. The effects of transgene, wild parent and hybrid generation on hybrid seed germination were examined. No significant effect of insect-resistant transgenes (Bt and CpTI) was detected on the seed dormancy of crop-wild hybrids, while a significant wild parent effect was found. The seeds of advanced generation hybrids have higher germination percentages and lower dormancy than do those of F1 and BC1 generations. The study showed that the dormancy of hybrid seeds was determined mainly by their genetic backgrounds. All hybrid seeds have higher germination percentages and lower dormancy (and, consequently, a poorer overwintering ability), compared with wild seeds, and reduce dormancy would contribute to a fitness disadvantage, compared with wild types. Therefore, such seeds might form part of naturally occurring soil seed banks, through which crop genes would persist in wild populations.

Seeds of alpine plants are short lived: implications for long-term conservation	ANNALS OF BOTANY												Background and Aims Alpine plants are considered one of the groups of species most sensitive to the direct and indirect threats to ecosystems caused by land use and climate change. Collecting and banking seeds of plant species is recognized as an effective tool for providing propagating material to re-establish wild plant populations and for habitat repair. However, seeds from cold wet environments have been shown to be relatively short lived in storage, and therefore successful long-term seed conservation for alpine plants may be difficult. Here, the life spans of 69 seed lots representing 63 related species from alpine and lowland locations from northern Italy are compared. Methods Seeds were placed into experimental storage at 45 degrees C and 60% relative humidity (RH) and regularly sampled for germination. The time taken in storage for viability to fall to 50% (p(50)) was determined using probit analysis and used as a measure of relative seed longevity between seed lots. Key Results Across species, p50 at 45 degrees C and 60% RH varied from 4.7 to 95.5 d. Seed lots from alpine populations/species had significantly lower p50 values compared with those from lowland populations/species; the lowland seed lots showed a slower rate of loss of germinability, higher initial seed viability, or both. Seeds were progressively longer lived with increased temperature and decreased rainfall at the collecting site. Conclusions Seeds of alpine plants are short lived in storage compared with those from lowland populations/related taxa. The lower resistance to ageing in seeds of alpine plants may arise from low selection pressure for seed resistance to ageing and/or damage incurred during seed development due to the cool wet conditions of the alpine climate. Long-term seed conservation of several alpine species using conventional seed banking methods will be problematic.

Detecting karrikinolide responses in seeds of the Poaceae	AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The smoke-derived chemical karrikinolide commonly triggers seeds in the Brassicaceae, Solanaceae and Asteraceae families to germinate, yet species in the Poaceae-another major understorey and weed family-have responded to the chemical with mixed results. This study aimed to understand why some grass species respond to karrikinolide while others do not. Using a field-based seed-burial trial, dose-response experiment, and stratification experiment, we investigated whether karrikinolide could alleviate dormancy and trigger seeds to germinate for seven global agronomic weeds: Avena fatua L., Lolium rigidum Gaudin, Eragrostis curvula (Schrad.) Nees, Phalaris minor Retz., Hordeum glaucum Steud., Ehrharta calycina Sm. and Bromus diandrus Roth. Seeds of A. fatua were consistently stimulated to germinate with karrikinolide in all experiments, whether seeds were freshly collected or dormancy had been partially alleviated. In contrast, seeds of L. rigidum failed to respond to karrikinolide when the seeds were fresh, after-ripened in the laboratory, and even during natural dormancy loss in the field. Interestingly, although karrikinolide did not stimulate freshly collected E. curvula seeds to germinate, it hastened dormancy loss when applied during stratification. These findings are helpful for understanding the responses of grass species following fire. They also contribute to a growing body of research aimed at using karrikinolide as a tool for triggering uniform germination of seeds for enhancing restoration efforts and depleting the weed seed bank.

J	Westermann, JR; von der Lippe, M; Kowarik, I				Westermann, Janneke R.; von der Lippe, Moritz; Kowarik, Ingo			Seed traits, landscape and environmental parameters as predictors of species occurrence in fragmented urban railway habitats	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Urbanization particularly promotes habitat fragmentation, which in turn strongly affects biodiversity patterns. A major driver of species loss in isolated habitat patches is dispersal limitation. The relative importance of dispersal ability of species, spatial habitat configuration and local environmental conditions for predicting species composition is still unclear though. Addressing urban abandoned railway areas as study areas, we analyzed the relative importance of environmental versus landscape predictors (e.g. proportions of sealed, built-up and ruderal areas) using variation partitioning methods. To add the perspective of individual species dispersal ability, we characterized the effect of species traits on explained variation in species occurrence with a regression tree. The difference in explained variation in the occurrence of individual species (Delta Cfit) between a CCA with environmental predictors and environmental and landscape predictors together was analyzed. The results revealed that environmental predictors explained a slightly larger amount of variation than landscape predictors. Adding landscape predictors to the analysis with environmental predictors resulted in a sizeable increase in explained variation. The most important predictors in the CCA were photosynthetically active radiation, C/N-ratio in the soil and the proportion of ruderal habitats in the surroundings of the plots. The regression tree model showed higher Delta Cfit values for species with a long-term persistent soil seed bank. The lowest Delta Cfit values were found for species with a transient seed bank and long seeds. Linking dispersal-related traits to the predictability of species occurrence is a promising approach to reveal the interdependencies between environmental conditions, landscape configuration and species-specific dispersal abilities. Our results suggest that in fragmented urban habitats, a persistent seed bank is advantageous because it allows for stable populations once habitat patches have been colonized.					von der Lippe, Moritz/0000-0003-4760-1420												1439-1791						2011	12	1					29	37		10.1016/j.baae.2010.11.006							WOS:000288042500004

Effects of large wild boar disturbances on alpine soil seed banks	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Wild boar rooting is considered one of the main large soil disturbances affecting the structure and composition of plant communities in alpine grasslands. While direct consequences on plant community have been widely studied, their effects on soil seed banks have received little attention although rooting is assumed to determine the successional processes and ultimately the ecological recovery of the communities. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of wild boar rooting on species and community soil seed banks. The rooting effect was studied in terms of seed abundance and diversity in the most disturbed plant communities by wild boar in Pyrenean alpine grasslands. Two hundred soil core samples were collected at two depths to account for (short/long term) persistent and transient seed banks within and outside wild boar rooting in those grasslands. The 'seedling emergence method' was used to identify and quantify seeds from the germinable seed bank. The soil seed bank found within disturbances was smaller than expected. At the species level, the main type of seed bank represented in these grasslands was long-term persistent, comprising 75% of the seeds found. Rooting turned long-term persistent seed bank into short-term persistent and transient, by exposing seeds from the deepest part of the soil to germination conditions at the surface of disturbed areas. At the community level we found that rooting homogenized soil seed banks by increasing seed abundance and species richness in species-poor communities, while decreasing seed species dominance in nitrophilous communities. These results suggest a deep alteration of the structure of seed banks by wild boar rooting, which in turn, may not represent a real chance for colonization from soil seed banks.

J	Harel, D; Holzapfel, C; Sternberg, M				Harel, Danny; Holzapfel, Claus; Sternberg, Marcelo			Seed mass and dormancy of annual plant populations and communities decreases with aridity and rainfall predictability	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Several theoretical and empirical studies have examined the influence of environmental conditions on seed traits and germination strategies of annual species. A positive relationship between seed mass and dormancy has been described for annuals occupying climatically unpredictable ecosystems. Larger-seeded species tend to have higher seedling survival rates, while dormancy allows a bet-hedging strategy in unpredictable environments. Until now, these ideas have been addressed primarily for only one or a few focal species, without considering differences among populations and communities. The novelty of the present study lies in the population and community-level approach, where a comprehensive seed trait database including 158 annual species occurring along a gradient of rainfall variability and aridity in Israel was used to ask the following question: Does average seed mass and dormancy of annual populations and communities decrease with increasing aridity and rainfall unpredictability? Soil seed bank samples were collected at the end of the summer drought, before the onset of the rains, from four plant communities. Germination was tested under irrigated conditions during three consecutive germination seasons to determine the overall seed germinability in each soil sample. Seed mass was obtained from newly produced seeds collected at the study sites in late spring. The community level results showed that, in contrast to common theoretical knowledge, seed mass and dormancy of the dominant annual species decreased with increasing aridity and rainfall variability. Accordingly, a negative correlation was found between seed mass and seed germination fractions. The present study demonstrates that an analysis of seed traits along climatic gradients is significantly improved by approaches that target both population and community levels simultaneously. A critical evaluation sheds new light upon the selective pressures that act on seed ecology of annuals along a climatic gradient and facilitates formulation of more mechanistic hypotheses about factors governing critical seed traits.																	1439-1791	1618-0089					2011	12	8					674	684		10.1016/j.baae.2011.09.003							WOS:000299187500004

Spatially-restricted plant material application creates colonization initials for flood-meadow restoration	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Plant material transfer is a well-established technique for overcoming dispersal limitation during grassland restoration. As restoration sites are frequently more abundant than donor sites, the plant material is often applied as patches or strips, with the assumption that these will act as colonization initials from which transferred species will spread and eventually cover the entire sites. Our aim was to test this assumption and to evaluate whether it is feasible to restore entire sites by spatially-restricted plant material application in a flood-meadow ecosystem. We established transverse transects consisting of eight 2 x 2 m plots on five plant material strips 7-8 years after plant material application. We monitored the above-ground vegetation development, analyzed the seed rain and determined the composition of the soil seed bank, i.e. we compared three different components of the emerging flood-meadow community. Transferred species were present in all three community components studied, and 88.6% of the 79 species we found in total had already spread from the plant material strips and colonized their surroundings. Detected dispersal distances differed between community components, and the share of colonizers was highest for the above-ground vegetation and lowest for the soil seed bank. We conclude that plant material transfer is a suitable technique for restoring flood-meadows as transferred species not only establish on the sites supplied with plant material, but also colonize their surroundings.

J	Jacquemyn, H; Van Mechelen, C; Brys, R; Honnay, O				Jacquemyn, Hans; Van Mechelen, Carmen; Brys, Rein; Honnay, Olivier			Management effects on the vegetation and soil seed bank of calcareous grasslands: An 11-year experiment	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Calcareous grasslands, most of which are man made and therefore depend on some kind of human interference for their maintenance, are among the most species-rich communities on Earth at a small scale. For many centuries, most of these grasslands have been used as extensive pasture. However, after 1900, and particularly from 1940 onwards, livestock grazing has declined throughout Europe leading to the abandonment of low intensity grasslands over large areas. To conserve the remaining grasslands or to restore recently abandoned grasslands, better insights about the effects of grassland management on above and belowground species diversity are needed. Here, we describe the results of an 11-year experiment to investigate the role of grassland management (grazing, mowing and abandonment) in determining species composition and diversity both in the aboveground vegetation and the seed bank of a calcareous grassland in Belgium. Species diversity declined by about 60% 11 years after abandonment, from 29 species m(-2) to as few as 12 species m(-2). Plots that were grazed remained constant in species richness, whereas mown sites lost about 20% of their original species. Abandoned plots were largely dominated by a few grass species, in particular Festuca nibra. Concomitant with changes in the aboveground vegetation, both the number of species found in the seed bank and seed density (number of seeds m(-2)) had changed significantly 11 years after abandonment. Species diversity and seed density were significantly lower in abandoned plots than in grazed or mown plots. We conclude that abandonment of calcareous grasslands may lead to rapid decline of plant species diversity both in the aboveground vegetation and in the seed bank. As a result, seed banks probably have a limited role to play in the restoration of recently abandoned grasslands. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

A framework for a risk assessment for weed species and management practices used in cropping systems with glyphosate-resistant cotton will aid decision making for resistance management. We developed this framework and then assessed the biological characteristics of 65 species and management practices from 50 cotton growers. This enabled us to predict the species most likely to evolve resistance, and the situations in which resistance is most likely to occur. Species with the highest resistance risk were Brachiaria eruciformis, Conyza bonariensis, Urochloa panicoides, Chloris virgata, Sonchus oleraceus and Echinochloa colona. The summer fallow and non-irrigated glyphosate-resistant cotton were the highest risk phases in the cropping system. When weed species and management practices were combined, C. bonariensis in summer fallow and other winter crops were at very high risk. S. oleraceus had very high risk in summer and winter fallow, as did C. virgata and E. colona in summer fallow. This study enables growers to identify potential resistance risks in the species present and management practices used on their farm, which will to facilitate a more targeted weed management approach to prevent development of glyphosate resistance.

Seed release in serotinous lodgepole pine forests after mountain pine beetle outbreak	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												There are concerns that large-scale stand mortality due to mountain pine beetle (MPB) could greatly reduce natural regeneration of serotinous Rocky Mountain (RM) lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) because the closed cones are held in place without the fire cue for cone opening. We selected 20 stands (five stands each of live [control], 3 years since MPB [3-yr-MPB], 6 years since MPB [6-yr-MPB], and 9 years since MPB [9-yr-MPB] mortality) in north central British Columbia, Canada. The goal was to determine partial loss of serotiny due to fall of crown-stored cones via breakage of branches and in situ opening of canopy cones throughout the 2008 and 2009 growing seasons. We also quantified seed release by the opening of forest-floor cones, loss of seed from rodent predation, and cone burial. Trees killed by MPB three years earlier dropped; similar to 3.5 times more cones via branch breakage compared to live stands. After six years, MPB-killed stands had released 45% of their canopy seed bank through cone opening, cone fall due to breakage, and squirrel predation. Further losses of canopy seed banks are expected with time since we found 9-yr-MPB stands had 38% more open canopy cones. This was countered by the development of a modest forest-floor seed bank (6% of the original canopy seed bank) from burial of cones; this seed bank may be ecologically important if a fire or anthropogenic disturbance reexposes these cones. If adequate levels of regeneration are to occur, disturbances to create seedbeds must occur shortly after tree mortality, before the seed banks are lost. Our findings also suggest that the sustained seed rain (over at least nine years) after MPB outbreak may be beneficial for population growth of ground-foraging vertebrates. Our study adds insight to the seed ecology of serotinous pines under a potentially continental-wide insect outbreak, threatening vast forests adapted to regeneration after fire.

SEED BANK CHANGES WITH TIME-SINCE-FIRE IN FLORIDA ROSEMARY SCRUB	FIRE ECOLOGY												The soil seed bank plays a central role in the regeneration of obligate seeding species in fire-prone habitats. We evaluated how seed density and species composition changed with time-since-fire in the Florida, USA, rosemary scrub community. Because fire affects habitat availability and plant demographic variation, we predicted that soil seed density would be low in recently burned and long-unburned stands and high at intermediate time-since-fire. Seed bank soil samples were collected from a chronosequence of time-since-fire composited from two trials conducted in 1992-1993 and 2008-2009: two sites each of 3, 6, 10, and 24 years post-fire, and 3 long-unburned (similar to 67 years) sites. The seedling emergence method was used to determine species composition of the seed bank. Across all time-since-fire age classes, herbaceous species dominated the seed bank, while long-lived subshrubs and shrubs were present in low densities. Seed banks from sites three years post-fire were distinct from the other sites. When species were sorted as functional groups, seed density was related with time-since-fire for subshrubs and ruderal herbs, but not for scrub herbs and graminoids. Subshrubs and ruderal herbs had highest seed densities in recently burned stands. Seed densities of Florida rosemary (Ceratiola ericoides Michx.) (the major obligate seeding shrub in this community) were associated with time-since-fire and showed highest densities at recently burned and long-unburned sites. The seed banks of two scrub herb species, paper nailwort (Paronychia chartacea Fernald) and nodding pinweed (Lechea cernua Small), were associated with time-since-fire. They reached peaks in density in the first ten years post-fire, corresponding with similar changes in their aboveground abundances with time-since-fire. Soil seed densities of several species and functional groups were associated with time-since-fire, but timing of peak seed density varied depending on species' life span and age of reproductive maturity.

J	Koch, MA; Scheriau, C; Schupfner, M; Bernhardt, KG				Koch, Marcus A.; Scheriau, Charlotte; Schupfner, Martin; Bernhardt, Karl-Georg			Long-term monitoring of the restoration and development of limestone grasslands in north western Germany: Vegetation screening and soil seed bank analysis	FLORA												We analysed the long-term development of limestone grasslands in West- and Central Europe (Mesobromion: Gentiano-Koelerietum) under conditions of restoration comparing vegetation changes with the composition of its corresponding soil seed bank over a time period from 1992 to 2005. Because of optimal climatic, edaphic and geomorphologic conditions restoration of vegetation developed gradually into the optimal phase of the typical limestone grassland vegetation type. However, the development of the soil seed bank compared to that of the actual vegetation cover is much slower, and even after 13 years all three study plots did not reach the optimal phase compared to soil seed bank composition from well-developed control vegetation nearby. This finding agrees with the assumption that after changes of management limestone grasslands need decades or even centuries to develop into self-sustaining species-rich habitats. We also monitored the orchid Ophrys insectifera as target species and characteristic species of this type of plant association over the last 27 years. Here, population density increased continuously over time indicating that vegetation restoration efforts of the last decades have had a positive effect. We further documented that the data obtained for the soil seed bank largely depend on the applied method used for the characterization of the soil seed bank. The seedling emergence and the rinsing method provided different results, and in case of our study area the rinsing method was mostly superior. The rinsing method detected up to 20fold higher total seed numbers. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The study was done in an initial ecosystem, namely an artificially constructed catchment on Pleistocene sands in eastern Germany. The import and export of seeds (including soil seed bank and seed rain), the development of vegetation cover and the population size of all pioneer species were recorded in 2005-2009. The interplay between the spatial distribution of seed rain and the prevailing wind direction provide evidence that seeds of Conyza canadensis (Asteraceae) first and to a considerable amount left the developing ecosystem. A change from a sink to source dynamics was detected already in the first year of both the existence of the site and occurrence of C. canadensis individuals within the site. Population patterns at the landscape unit scale demonstrated extensive auto-correlations in the coverage of this invasive plant at first. Our results underline the pioneer traits of C. canadensis as a prolific seeder and excellent wind disperser, which enables this species to become rapidly dominant over relatively large areas.

Seeds that persist in soil incur physiological costs of maintaining viability and vigor, thus, the growth capability of resulting plants may be reduced. However, a lot of functional roles of the PSSB have been deduced from seed germination capability, and little consideration has been given to interspecific and intraspecific competitive ability of the resulting plants. Eupatorium adenophorum was used as the study species to compare germination of different artificially aged PSSB seeds and competition at different densities between resulting plants of aged and freshly produced seeds. Seed burial caused decreases in survival rates but not germination speed. During the 175-day growth period, the individual biomass, average height, basal stem diameter and leaf number of plants from aged PSSB seeds were little lower than that of plants germinated from freshly produced seeds. However, the differences were not significant at any densities. Thus, (1) although seeds stored in soil exhibited a very high death rate, they maintained a high vigor for germination, and (2) resulting plants from PSSB seeds exhibited good competiveness to plants from new seeds of the same population. The results further confirm the significance of PSSB in maintaining stability of plant populations and communities. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Coffee Biotechnology: Implications for Crop Improvement and Germplasm Conservation	I INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON TROPICAL HORTICULTURE	Acta Horticulturae				1st International Symposium on Tropical Horticulture	NOV 22-26, 2010	Kingston, JAMAICA	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)				Advances in biotechnology have revolutionized breeding and processing of many tropical crops, leading to improved crop management. Coffee, one of the most important beverages in the world, is produced in about 80 tropical countries with an annual production of nearly seven million tons of green beans. Many livelihoods in developing countries are dependent on this crop. Explosion of plant biotechnology has led to many advances in the field of coffee production, including breeding and cultivar development, resistance to pests and diseases, quality improvement (aroma, flavor and caffeine content), product diversification, and post harvest technology. The cultivated species of coffee have a very narrow genetic base. Wild species of coffee offer future breeding potential for crop improvement. With many wild species being lost due to various land uses, conservation of these valuable genetic resources in ex situ genebanks and through seed banking become imperative. Utilization of modern biotechnology techniques such as tissue culture, genetic transformation and molecular marker techniques offer great potential for future advances in crop improvement and germplasm conservation.																	0567-7572	2406-6168	978-90-66050-67-9				2011	894						33	44									WOS:000323843600002						
J	Armstrong, G; Legge, S				Armstrong, Graeme; Legge, Sarah			The post-fire response of an obligate seeding Triodia species (Poaceae) in the fire-prone Kimberley, north-west Australia	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE												Triodia spp. have been described as behaving functionally as a shrub because above ground biomass accumulates slowly over time culminating as the dominant vegetation layer. When combined with high flammability, little seed dormancy and conflicting evidence for fire induced seed germination, obligate seeding species may be more vulnerable to short fire intervals than resprouting species. This study investigated the post-fire regeneration response of the obligate seeder Triodia sp. nov. (aff. T. schinzii Henrard) in the fire prone Kimberley, Western Australia. Adult plants were destroyed by fire in experimental plots to assess the degree of regeneration from either resprouting or germination from seed due to fire. To control for the removal of adults, without fire, plants were pulled out by hand in replicate plots. Germination of Triodia sp. nov. seed from the soil seed bank was strongly induced by fire. Establishment and survival of seedlings through the first dry season was high with a small proportion of individuals flowering at this time. It is concluded that Triodia sp. nov. is resilient to the short fire intervals experienced in the Kimberley where it is a successful localised species.

Cryopreservation of Embryonic Axes of Castor Bean Cultivar 'AL-Guarany 2002'	INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CRYOPRESERVATION IN HORTICULTURAL SPECIES	Acta Horticulturae				1st International Symposium on Cryopreservation in Horticultural Species	APR 05-08, 2009	Leuven, BELGIUM	Int Soc Hort Sci (ISHS)				The castor bean (Ricinus communis) is an oleaginous plant with many applications in the society and economy. Castor bean seeds tolerate storage in seed banks for a short period compared to orthodox seeds, probably due to its high lipid content. This study aimed elaborate a cryopreservation protocol for castor bean embryonic axes. After seeds disinfection, embryonic axes of the cultivar 'AL-Guarany 2002' were isolated, dehydrated and inoculated directly on culture medium (control) or cryostored in liquid nitrogen at -196 degrees C, during one hour, in the presence or absence of cryoprotectant solutions (PVS2 or modified PVS2) prior to inoculation on culture. It was obtained 100% of in vitro regeneration for all treatments. After acclimatization a surviving rate of 100% was obtained for embryonic axes cryostored only in liquid nitrogen. Axes stored in the presence of PVS2 presented a survival rate of 35%. The results obtained showed that the cryopreservation of castor bean embryonic axes in LN without cryoprotectants is a suitable technique to preserve the genetics resources of this species.

Results showed that A.squarrosum adapted easily to the mobile and semi-mobile sand dune. At the process of sand dune fixation (restoration of sandy land), the number of A.squarrosum population decreased gradually, and there were no A.squarrosum occurred at the fixed sand dune; at a mobile sand dune, A.squarrosum population distributed in patch, and mainly distributed at the two sides of sand dune, base and centre of windward slope. In the different desert vegetation, if there were bare patches of sand soil, there was A. squarrosum. A. squarrosum population at the different sand dune, the different positions of the mobile sand dune and the different vegetation communities were clumped distribution. The spatial distribution characteristics of A.squarrosum population were affected by biological and environmental factors. The biological factors included that the germination of A.squarrosum was suitable in darkness which was brought by sand burial, the soil seeds of A.squarrosum distributed at the topsoil layer of 0-5cm and decreased gradually in the restoration process sandy land, and A.squarrosum was easy to develop sand tongue which had the role of accumulating seeds. Those results proved that A.squarrosum was a typical psammophyte.																			978-988-19116-7-4				2011							13	17									WOS:000393087400004

Here, we analyzed reproductive traits (allocation to reproduction, efficiency of seed production, and seed size) at the community level and their relationships to seed dynamics (seed production, dispersal, storage, loss, and germination) in a Mediterranean and a semiarid ecosystem in Israel. The results showed that aboveground biomass production was two-fold greater in the Mediterranean community compared to the semiarid. Conversely, relative reproductive allocation in the semiarid community almost doubled that of the Mediterranean. Seed size and seed output correlated negatively but, despite large differences in seed production between communities (73% higher in the semiarid site), average seed size was similar between sites. Seed losses in the semiarid community were significantly greater than those in the Mediterranean (80% vs. 13%), and contrasting seed-density patterns between the communities were noted. Despite small seed sizes, dispersal was of low importance and did not differ between communities. Our results show that whereas some plant traits are reflected at the community level according to theoretical functional predictions, others fail to follow the expected patterns due to variations in the relative importance of environmental constraints and the existence of alternative strategies for coping with them.																	1565-9801	2224-4662					2011	57	1-2			SI		73	90		10.1560/IJEE.57.1-2.73							WOS:000299694500007

Protocol considerations for aquatic plant seed bank assessment	JOURNAL OF AQUATIC PLANT MANAGEMENT												Many procedures have been developed to assess seed bank characteristics, and most can be grouped into either of 2 categories: seedling emergence assays or seed separation from substrate. These procedures are particularly useful in predicting vegetation recurrence and determining need for restoration or control strategies through estimates of seed bank attributes (e.g., species composition, density, distribution, and viability). However, due to the lack of a standard protocol for seed bank investigations, researchers must select appropriate methods based on knowledge of different techniques and their potential to accomplish research goals. Here, we review a range of procedures for aquatic/wetland seed bank assessment with regard to difficulty in use, test reliability and accuracy, and laboratory resource (time, space, and labor) requirements. Information to improve sample collection and analysis is provided, and research to enhance seed/seedling identification and knowledge of germination requirements is advised.																	0146-6623					JAN	2011	49						9	19									WOS:000290290000002

We examined the impacts of grazing on plant richness and density in the soil seed bank in regard to the different dispersal and life strategy types of the herb layer taxa. Soil seed bank was qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed and contrasting plant guilds were defined according to life strategy type and dispersal mode. Soil seed bank differences between a) the upper and lower soil layers and b) plant functional guild pairs (ruderals vs. non ruderals, including typical forest taxa, and physically-vs. animal-dispersed plants) were statistically tested in overgrazed and sporadically grazed plots. Moreover, correlations in soil seed bank species dominance between overgrazed and sporadically grazed plots were examined by Spearman's Rank correlation. The majority of seeds were found in the upper (0-5 cm) soil layer. Seed density in the deeper (5-10 cm) soil layer was rather poor and did not differ significantly between overgrazed and sporadically grazed plots. In the upper soil layer, both seed density and plant species richness were significantly lower in the overgrazed plots. Overgrazing reduced both species richness and seed density of non-ruderal species in general and typical forest herbs in particular, while it did not affect ruderal species richness and density. Plant species richness and seed density of animal-dispersed taxa were reduced by overgrazing while physically-dispersed species were not affected; it is therefore concluded that large herds of grazers fenced in relatively small areas cannot act as efficient dispersal vectors of the former species. Our findings suggest that, upon cessation of grazing, the soil seed bank is rather inadequate to restore the herb layer of overgrazed forest sites.

J	Dalling, JW; Davis, AS; Schutte, BJ; Arnold, AE				Dalling, James W.; Davis, Adam S.; Schutte, Brian J.; Arnold, A. Elizabeth			Seed survival in soil: interacting effects of predation, dormancy and the soil microbial community	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												P>1. Plant defence theory provides a robust framework for understanding interactions between plants and antagonists, and for interpreting broad patterns in the functional-trait composition of plant communities. However, this framework has been built almost entirely on traits expressed by seedlings and mature plants. 2. No equivalent seed defence theory exists that recognizes the distinct suite of natural enemies that seeds encounter, and the unique constraints to their response. Furthermore, most attention has been paid to insect and vertebrate seed predators active above ground, whereas microbes in soil also have large effects on seed survival, particularly for plants that recruit from soil seed banks. 3. We suggest that concurrent selection on seed dormancy and resistance to microbial antagonists should result in distinct seed defence syndromes. We predict that species with physical seed dormancy will rely on physical defences to exclude predators and pathogens, and rapid seed germination to escape pathogens at the emergence stage. In contrast, species with physiological seed dormancy will deploy a continuum of physical and chemical defences, depending on soil pathogen pressure and duration of seed persistence. Finally, seeds of some species persist in the soil in a non-dormant, imbibed state, and lack obvious chemical and physical defences. These seeds may be especially dependent upon protection from beneficial seed-inhabiting microbes. 4. Framing a general 'seed defence theory' may help to account for the distribution of seed dormancy types across ecosystems. We predict that physiological dormancy will be favoured in dry or well-drained environments where pathogen pressure is relatively low, germination cues are most unpredictable, and seedling recruitment success is most variable. In contrast, physical dormancy should be favoured in warm and moist environments where pathogen pressure is high, and where germination cues are a stronger predictor of recruitment success. Persistent, non-dormant seeds are restricted to relatively aseasonal environments where favourable conditions for recruitment can occur over most of the year. 5. Synthesis. Integrating seed defence and dormancy traits can provide new insights into selection on dormancy types, and will help elucidate major trends in seed ecology and evolution. Understanding how seeds are defended also may improve our ability to predict plant regeneration and help develop innovative management strategies for weedy and invasive species.

This study examines rise size, species richness, diversity, uniformity, and similarity of soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation in 6 different grazing lands including coastal pasture, reseeded pasture, artificial pasture, lowland shrubland, ungrazed pasture, and hillside shrubland. Forty-eight soil samples were taken by cores with a diameter and depth of 10 cm from each of grazing lands in August of 2007. A vegetation survey was conducted using a 0.5 x 0.5-m quadrant in both the spring and fall. Eighty species were observed in soil seed hanks and aboveground vegetation. The largest seed bank was observed in reseeded pasture (7,715 seed/m(2)), while the smallest seed bank was found in coastal pasture (2,755 seed/m(2)). Coastal pasture also possessed the least amount of aboveground vegetation (131 plants/m(2). The most aboveground vegetation was found in ungrazed pasture (155 Plano/m(2)). The most common species in seed banks were annual and perennial grasses in reseeded pasture, annual forbs in artificial pasture and hillside shrubland, and perennial forbs in low shrubland and ungrazed pasture. Species richness, diversity, and uniformity in seed banks were highest in lowland shrubland and lowest in artificial pasture. The seed bank and aboveground vegetation were similar in ungrazed pasture, coastal pasture, reseeded pasture, low shrubland, hillside shrubland and artificial pasture. Shrublands play an important role in species richness and the number of germinated seeds from seed banks of grazing lands in southern Marmara. The results showed that reseeding or a decrease in grazing pressure may improve the condition of grazing lands.																	0255-965X					JAN-JUN	2011	39	1					96	106									WOS:000292056600014

'Robinson') was examined at two locations under dry farming conditions in Kermanshah province, Iran, in 2009. Experiments were conducted based on a randomized complete block design with three replications; the treatments consisted of control (no fertilizer), chemical fertilizer, biological fertilizer and different combinations of chemical and biological fertilizing systems. The results showed that application of different fertilizing systems had a highly significant effect (P<0.001) on the number of pods per plant. The highest values were obtained in the treatment using the urea chemical fertilizer + phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria + mycorrhiza. The highest soil seed bank was recorded in the nitrogen-fixing bacteria + phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria treatment; it increased the number of seeds by approximately 50 percent compared to the control (only 134 pod containing seeds). The highest pod yield was obtained after applying nitrogen-fixing bacteria + mycorrhiza (445 kg/ha), the lowest yield in the control treatment (266 kg/ha). In general, under the conditions of this experiment, the seed yield of annual medic, var. 'Robinson' receiving nitrogen-fixing + phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria out-yielded other fertilizing treatments. This indicates a synergistic interaction between these groups of bacteria that increases seed yield, the soil seed bank as well as the seed phosphorus uptake of this plant species under dry farming conditions.

Such selective feeding of earthworms on plant seeds is likely to favour certain plant species and to affect seed bank composition, plant recruitment and plant community structure. Relationships between earthworms and seeds, particularly seed traits that determine attractiveness of seeds for earthworms, are yet to be determined. In this study, the influence of six seed traits was tested on the ingestion, digestion and germination of seeds by two earthworm species (Lumbricus terrestris, anecic and Satchellius mammoths, epigeic). The seed traits tested were their length, width, weight, shape, oil content and the presence of trichomes on their surface. Each earthworm species was introduced into a microcosm with eleven seed species from a chalk grassland that represented those different traits. Ingested, digested and germinated seeds were counted after voiding the guts of the earthworms. (Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that seed length, width, weight and seed oil content could significantly affect the ingestion of seeds for both earthworm species. Seed width and seed oil content were the two traits that influenced the digestion of seeds the most, but only for L. terrestris. We also found that seed ingestion was earthworm species-specific but we found no correlation between earthworm traits and number of ingested or digested seeds. Few seeds germinated from L. terrestris casts and no seeds germinated from S. mammalis casts. Implications in terms of plant evolution strategies are further discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

Allometric patterns of below-ground biomass in Mediterranean grasslands	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Below-ground biomass might play an important role in the persistence of grasslands. The summertime water stress of Mediterranean grasslands very much accounts for annual plants in their communities. These plants die off in summer, and the soil seed bank ensures the grasslands' recovery every autumn. Temperature decreases with altitude, together with the proportion of annual and perennial herbs. This paper explores the vertical profile of this biomass in grasslands on the Iberian Peninsula along an altitudinal gradient and two geomorphological positions in each site. Both factors were considered to determine the development of below-ground biomass. We also took into consideration the experimental exclusion of livestock, considering that the presence or absence of herbivores may influence the aerial and underground structure of the grasslands. Using an allometric approach, we examined the relative distribution of below-ground biomass with depth and its temporal variation ("construction"). We found that there is a general allometric pattern in the vertical profile of variation of below-ground biomass in which density is inversely proportional to the depth of the stratum raised to the power of 1.8 (at high elevations) and 2.5 (low elevations). The construction process of these grasslands exhibits slight variations within a common pattern. Growth of the plant canopy can be temporally limited by the action of herbivores, a more complex underground structure thereby developing, with more strata and a more even biomass distribution. An adaptive reaction to the notable Mediterranean seasonal change appears to occur but, surprisingly, may depend upon altitude rather than upon the influence of herbivory.

Causes of arrested succession in coastal dune forest	PLANT ECOLOGY												Dispersal or recruitment limitation may arrest succession after disturbance. In north-eastern South Africa the Acacia karroo successional pathway is used to facilitate coastal forest recovery after strip-mining. However, although A. karroo establishes naturally, it forms monospecific stands, arresting forest succession for decades. This casts doubt on the efficacy of this restoration pathway. We investigated the causes of arrested succession. The seed and seedling banks of A. karroo stands and of forest at Cape Vidal, and three A. karroo stands (7-27 years old) on rehabilitated strip-mined dunes at nearby Richards Bay were examined. The establishment and growth of seedlings at Cape Vidal were also considered. The seed bank was larger and more diverse in forest, but the seedling bank was larger in Acacia stands. At Richards Bay, the size of the seed bank increased and the seedling bank decreased with Acacia stand age. Excluding mammalian herbivores in Acacia stands at Cape Vidal resulted in greater species richness and survival of naturally established seedlings, as well as two experimentally planted species. Neither seed dispersal nor seedling establishment limited recruitment of tree species in Acacia stands. Herbivory arrested forest succession by causing the differential mortality of seedlings. In contrast, at Richards Bay where there were few mammalian herbivores, the advanced regeneration in A. karroo stands converged on the diversity of nearby forests 29 years after restoration. Controlling herbivore access and seeding Acacia stands with forest species are site-specific options for preventing arrested succession when using the A. karroo successional pathway.

This is explained as an escape from inadequate conditions. In the current study, we investigated the seed germination of a dimorphic species Atriplex inflata Much. (Chenopodiaceae). A. inflata occurs in saline habitats, namely in arid regions. Its bracteoles enclose a brown or a black fruit. This unit constitutes the diaspore. Methods - Mature fruits were collected from Kelbia (35 degrees 46'06 '' N 10 degrees 07'34 '' E), located in the centre of Tunisia, with semi-arid climate. The effect of cold stratification, nitrate (KNO(3), 10 mM), light, dry storage (for seven months), chemical scarification and salt pretreatment on germination were determined in order to assess the factors that control germination and dormancy. Key results - The results show that brown fruits germinated rapidly and the final germination percentage was 98% after twenty days. However, germination of black fruits was slower and reached only 19%. This confirms the fact that the difference in morphology is accompanied by a difference in germination capacity and dormancy in A. inflata. Chemical scarification and dry storage increased germination capacity of black fruits. Thus, the black fruit showed a physical dormancy and a non-deep physiological dormancy. Conclusion - The production of two types of fruit in A. inflata, one dormant and the other non-dormant, is of high ecological importance for the survival of populations. Actually, this ensures both rapid germination (brown fruits) and a permanent seed bank (black fruits), which permit the persistence of the species and population establishment in disturbed environments.

Material and methods - The species composition of the aboveground vegetation and the soil seed bank were examined on sites after a 25-year grazing exclusion in a typical steppe on the Loess Plateau, NW China. Key results - Results showed that long-term grazing exclusion significantly improved vegetation cover, biomass and aboveground species evenness. Long-term grazing exclusion significantly increased species richness and seed density in the soil seed bank, but significantly decreased belowground species evenness. The seeds were mainly present in the litter and the topsoil (0-5 cm), accounting for about 76% of the total seed number. Exclusion of grazing significantly decreased seed depletion in soil seed bank from April to July as compared to grazed sites. The Sorensen similarity index between aboveground and belowground species composition was low in the typical steppe, and long-term grazing exclusion did not significantly improve this similarity. Conclusion - Our results suggest that long-term grazing exclusion can significantly improve both aboveground and belowground species diversity in the steppe vegetation of the Loess Plateau, but has little or no effect on the similarity in composition between the two compartments.

J	Van Assehe, JA; Cornelissen, D; Vandelook, F				Van Assehe, Jozef A.; Cornelissen, Dominique; Vandelook, Filip			Germination ecology of Sison amomum (Apiaceae) at the northern edge of its distribution range on the European mainland	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Background and aims - Sison amomum reaches the north-western limit of its distribution on the European mainland as a rare species in a very small area in western Belgium. For conservation management it is important to know different aspects of life history such as seed longevity, phenology of germination and survival of seedlings. Methods - Germination requirements in field and laboratory conditions were analyzed in detail. Survival of seedlings in winter conditions was recorded. Key results - Most seeds germinated soon after dispersal in autumn. Eighty percent of the autumn seedlings survived winter conditions and grew up to flowering plants in the 2(nd) and 3(rd) calendar year. Buried seeds survived till next spring, but later on very few seeds were able to germinate after exhumation, thus no persistent seed bank was formed. In fresh seeds, the underdeveloped embryo (embryo to seed ratio = c. 0.35) immediately started to grow in light conditions at low temperatures (5, 10 degrees C and alternating 20/10 degrees C); when the critical E:S ratio of 0.82 was reached after two to four weeks, the radicle protruded. In darkness and at 20 or 23 degrees C growth of the embryo was very slow and very few seeds germinated. Conclusions - The small seeds of S. amonium are morphologically dormant, and germinate very soon in light at lower temperatures. No persistent seed bank is formed. Based on life history characteristics revealed in this study, we propose a mowing of the grasslands in late autumn to protect this threatened plant. Well timed mowing reduces the biomass and decreases the competition, while still allowing seed set and dispersal of S. amomum.																	2032-3913						2011	144	3					321	326		10.5091/plecevo.2011.638							WOS:000297569500012

The tasteful fruits, extensively used for nutrition, are also good for health due to the high content in vitamins, minerals, and dietary fibers. Like majority of the woody fruit plants, Citrus germplasm is conserved mainly as field collections in clonal orchards. However, such a traditional approach presents several difficulties, among which are the high cost, manual labor, and extensive land required to maintain the collections, as well as the necessity of a careful protection of plants from diseases and extreme environmental conditions. As many species in the genus have seeds recalcitrant to desiccation, conservation in seed banks is also inadequate. On the other hand, cryopreservation, i.e., the storage of specimens at ultra-low temperatures (usually in liquid nitrogen, at -196 degrees C) where reactions within the cells are minimized, presents a unique alternative for the safe storage of such germplasm. The present contribution outlines the cryopreservation techniques applied to seeds, zygotic and somatic embryos, embryogenic callus cultures of Citrus spp. and provides sample protocols to be used for Citrus conservation.

PLANT SPECIES BIOLOGY												Wet forest ecosystems in temperate regions have been heavily drained and logged, often with significant negative consequences for biodiversity in these habitats. Our research focused on population maintenance mechanisms of a declining wet forest sedge Carex loliacea L. We studied germination under different light regimes and seedling survival under different vegetation densities using an in situ removal experiment. For successful germination, seeds of C. loliacea need light; germination in reduced light conditions is depressed. The seeds of C. loliacea are able to accumulate a seed bank and exhibit seasonal dormancy cycles. Survival of seedlings strongly depends on competition with other plant species. Our results imply that changes in habitat conditions (draining, forest cutting) affect the successful generative reproduction of C. loliacea primarily via a change in light conditions, which is a strong factor both at the stage of germination and seedling growth. However, adult plants are able to persist over a much broader range of habitat conditions without detectable vitality loss.

Imidazolinone-Tolerant Rice: Red Rice Seed Bank and Gene Flow	PLANTA DANINHA												The objective of this study was to evaluate the rotation of the irrigated rice Clearfield (R) system with the conventional system in the evolution of the seed bank and the emergence of red rice biotypes resistant to the imidazolinone chemical group. The experiment was arranged in a randomized block design in a factorial scheme (2 x 4) with 4 replications. The first factor was constituted of the management systems used (Clearfield (R) x conventional) which consisted of the succession/rotation between the rice not tolerant to imidazoline, variety IRGA 417 (conventional), and the rice tolerant to imidazolinone, variety IRGA 422 CL (Clearfield (R)). The D factor was constituted by the variation between the conventional and the Clearfield (R) systems, over time. The use of the Clearfield (R) system provides a reduction of the seed bank after three years of use; however, it does not remove all the red rice seeds from the soil. The crossing between red rice and cultivated rice increases with the increase of infestation, reaching 2.9% after four crops.				de Avila, Luis Antonio/E-2892-2010	de Avila, Luis Antonio/0000-0002-2532-7152												0100-8358	1806-9681					2011	29				SI		1099	1105		10.1590/S0100-83582011000500017							WOS:000299127000017						
J	Li, YJ; Bao, WK; Wu, N				Li, Yanjiao; Bao, Weikai; Wu, Ning			SOIL SEED BANK AND EXTANT VEGETATION OF A DRY VALLEY	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Although crucial for guiding vegetation improvement efforts, soil seed bank (SSB) and extant vegetation (EV) in dry valleys remains poorly understood. A germination method and field surveys were applied to address this problem and investigate the characteristics of SSB and corresponding EV of eight sites across the dry Minjiang River valley in Southwest China. Furthermore, the relationships between SSB and EV were compared to provide guidance for vegetation enhancement. Eight sites were classified into two groups - central and transitional sites that differ according to moisture conditions. Seed density and species richness in SSB were lower in less moist central sites compared with those in more moist transitional sites of the valley as well as the coverage of the community. Moreover, species richness and litter thickness were lower in central sites. Comparing SSB strategies of species from eight sites, transient strategy was the most frequently observed category, followed by short-term persistent and long-term persistent strategies. In terms of both SSB and EV, the most abundant life forms were hemicryptophytes, intermediate phanerophytes, and therophytes, whereas less abundant were chamaephytes and cryptophytes. Low Sorenson's similarity indices (22-32%) and significantly negative Kendall's correlation in species composition indicate that species composition of SSB was not closely related to corresponding EV for each of the eight sites. Low seed density, especially the lack of viable dominant shrub seeds, dominant transient SSB strategy species, and low correspondence in species composition between SSB and EV imply that the potential for vegetation enhancement in the dry valley is weak, particularly in less moist central sites. To preserve the good EV of more moist transitional sites and introduce seeds of dominant species to improve poor EV in central sites, EV is likely to be a feasible standard for improving vegetation in dry valleys.

We modeled the life cycle of W. carteri and compared projected trajectories to independently observed trajectories (up to 16 years) of plants in 74 patches in three populations. We built matrix models with an annual time step for two populations, including four stages, (recently produced seeds, seeds in the seed bank, seedlings, and adults) and five vital rates, summarized in seven transitions. Fluctuations of both observed and modeled populations were evaluated using power spectra, autocorrelation, amplitude, and damping. Observed populations had two point cycling. Observed amplitude was higher in frequently burned populations, reached its maximum 1 year after fire, and then dampened. Asymptotic transition and vital rate elasticities showed that seedling survival was the most important factor for long-term population growth, but transient elasticities showed that recruitment from the seed bank was important during the first years post-fire. Deterministic modeling and elasticity analyses indicated that delayed germination (for 1 year) may explain biennial population cycling. Stochastic models created similar cycling with slower damping than deterministic models, but still had lower amplitudes (especially 1-3 years post-fire) than observed populations. The biennial cycle in W. carteri is likely caused by the delay in seed germination, which creates two overlapping cohorts of plants, much like a strict biennial. Fire initiates the cycle by killing aboveground individuals and promoting seedling recruitment in the first post-fire year.

Managing for rainfall variability: impacts of grazing strategies on perennial grass dynamics in a dry tropical savanna	RANGELAND JOURNAL												Rainfall variability remains a major challenge to sustainable grazing management in northern Australia with perennial grasses the key to the stability of the resources that maintain a sustainable grazing industry. This paper describes the dynamics of five perennial grasses - Bothriochloa ewartiana (Domin) C. E. Hubb., Chrysopogon fallax S. T. Blake, Aristida spp., Panicum effusum R. Br. and Heteropogon contortus (L.) P. Beauv. ex Roem. & Schult. in relation to three grazing strategies - moderate stocking at long-term carrying capacity, heavy stocking and rotational wet season spelling. The research was conducted in permanent quadrats on the predominant land type in an extensive grazing study in an Aristida-Bothriochloa pasture in north Australia between 1998 and 2010. Summer rainfall was above average for two periods 1998 2001 and 2008 2010 with drought and below-average rainfall from 2002 to 2007. Low rainfall affected the dynamics of all grasses by reducing survival and basal area through its effect on plant size; this impact was most noticeable for the shorter-lived Aristida spp., P. effusum and H. contortus. The impact of grazing was greatest on the long-lived B. ewartiana and C. fallax; this effect was accentuated by the 2002-07 drought. Heavy grazing during this period further reduced the survival and size of B. ewartiana in comparison with the moderate stocking and rotational spell treatments. In contrast, the survival of C. fallax was reduced in the moderate stocking and rotational spelling treatment during drought, relative to that under heavy grazing. The density of B. ewartiana declined even under moderate grazing and despite two sequences of above-average rainfall because seedling recruitment failed to offset mature plant death. Results from this study emphasised the importance of maintaining the existing populations of key long-lived species such as B. ewartiana through good management. These results also supported the overall findings from the grazing study indicating that stocking at the long-term carrying capacity is sustainable in managing for climate variability.																	1036-9872	1834-7541					2011	33	2					209	220		10.1071/RJ11032							WOS:000291944300011

RESTORATION ECOLOGY												A crucial question in ecological restoration is whether target species that are missing from aboveground vegetation are represented in the seed bank. We evaluated the role of persistent seed banks in the restoration of species richness, and the relative value of managed and unmanaged grasslands, by studying closely located and floristically similar mown and abandoned stands of fen and dry-mesophilous meadows. We found that a higher proportion of the target species detected in aboveground vegetation possessed persistent seed banks in fen meadows than in dry-mesophilous ones (44 and 29%, respectively). The proportion of target species found exclusively in the seed bank was much lower (11% for both meadow types). Conversely, common rushes (Juncus conglomeratus and J. effusus), mostly missing from the vegetation, dominated the seed banks in all fen meadow plots (50-94% of total seed densities) and were also detected in seed banks of dry-mesophilous meadows. We found that resumed mowing on previously abandoned meadows has promoted species richness and the flowering success of several species in comparison with unmanaged ones in both meadow types. Vegetation type had a stronger influence on seed bank richness and density than management status and we detected much higher seed bank densities in fen meadows (64,000-94,000 seeds/m2) than in dry-mesophilous ones (4,400-6,300 seeds/m2). Therefore, restoration of former richness could not be based exclusively on the local seed banks in the studied meadow types. Further management, such as hay transfer or seeding of target species, is required to increase species richness.

The restoration of arable weed communities have become an important issue in these habitats which have a large potential to contain rare and threatened (red-list) species. In a site in the Swiss Alps, formerly managed for crop production, we investigated in experimental plowed plots the 1-year effects of fertilizing, sowing a mixture of arable weed species and sowing a crop species (triticale) on the natural regeneration (species richness and cover) of arable weed and non-weed species. The high number of newly appeared arable weed species, of which four were red-list species, indicated that propagule availability was still important after about 50 years of arable field abandonment. Plowed plots which did not receive any treatment and those with fertilization alone favored the regeneration of both wild weed and non-weed species. The crop species limited, but did not inhibit, the recovery success of weed and non-weed species and this negative effect tended to be higher under fertilization. Sowing of arable weed seeds decreased the natural regeneration of both weeds and non-weeds in the absence of triticale. Our results show that plowing is a promising method to successfully restore the weed community in abandoned arable mountain areas. Moreover, the sowing of weed species in combination with a crop species might produce sustainable food and restore and maintain the diversity of threatened arable weeds at the same time.

Challenges Facing Seed Banks and Agriculture in Relation to Seed Quality	SEED DORMANCY: METHODS AND PROTOCOLS	Methods in Molecular Biology											Seeds form a convenient vehicle for storage of germplasm, both for agricultural purposes and conservation of wild species. When required, seeds can be taken from storage and germinated, and plants can be propagated for the desired purpose, e.g., crop production or biome restoration. However, seed dormancy often interferes with stand establishment or industrial utilization in crops and germination of wild species. An anticipated termination of dormancy (i.e., before crop harvest) also occurs, with preharvest sprouting as a consequence. In order to overcome these problems, a better understanding of dormancy is required. This chapter is devoted to discuss the achievement of such understanding in problematic species.

Comparative longevity and viability modeling of Solanum macrocarpon L. seeds	SEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												In a first experiment following a controlled deterioration (CD) protocol proposed by the Millennium Seed Bank Project (MSBP), seeds of six accessions of Solarium macrocarpon were stored at 45 degrees C / 60% RH and seed germination data was taken at intervals for 100 days to estimate comparative seed longevity among the accessions. The mean absolute seed longevity (P(50)) was 47.41 +/- 12.20 days indicating intermediate longevity between the two marker species proposed in the MSBP protocol. In a second experiment, seeds of one accession were stored at seed moisture contents between 2.5 and 11.2% at 10, 20 and 45 C to estimate seed viability constants for S. macrocarpon. Estimates of K(E) = 5.166, C(W) = 3.009, C(H) = 0.094, C(Q) = 0.0019 were derived, suggesting that the seeds exhibited less sensitivity to storage conditions in terms of K(E) and C(W) than the two marker species, but longevity responses to storage temperature were comparable to other orthodox species.

Mirb. in the Afromontane Forests of Ethiopia	SILVICULTURE IN THE TROPICS	Tropical Forestry											Podocarpus falcatus is one of the two coniferous species naturally growing up to 45 m high and 250 cm in diameter in 11 out of the 14 floral regions recognized in Ethiopia. It is a multipurpose species with a wider range of socioeconomic and environmental importance. The species provides high-class softwood considered superior to European deals. Suitably manufactured and conditioned, it produces wood suitable for many purposes. It is also useful for fuelwood, charcoal, poles, paper pulp, shade, and ornamental purposes. One of the most promising products from the trees is the oil extracted from its seeds, which is edible and used medicinally to treat gonorrhea. The trees also serve as parts of the habitat of various organisms. Despite its great importance, the species is on the verge of local extermination because of its unsustainable exploitation over the last several decades. Even after it has been banned from harvesting/cutting, its illegal exploitation continues unabated. Unfortunately, owing to a number of factors, there are neither large-scale plantations nor future planned plantation establishment programs of the species. This implies that urgent actions are required to address its unsustainable exploitation. The seed germination, seed and seedling banks, seedling survival and growth, regeneration along altitudinal, light, and moisture gradients as well as in some selected Afromontane forests and timber harvesting of the species are discussed. Human impact on the remaining populations of the species is described and recommendations to address the unsustainable exploitation are proposed.																	1614-9785		978-3-642-19985-1				2011							325	337		10.1007/978-3-642-19986-8_21	10.1007/978-3-642-19986-8						WOS:000293760700021

The mining ponds harbour a unique pond-bottom vegetation of high importance for nature conservation in Europe. Coleanthus subtilis, Limosella aquatica and Littorella uniflora are character species of this vegetation. Little is known about the dispersal mechanisms of these species. Especially Coleanthus subtilis is closely linked to the mining ponds that arc connected via ditches and subterranean trenches, leading to the hypothesis of hydrochory as a major dispersal mechanism for seeds of this species. Laboratory experiments showed a buoyancy of about one year for the seeds of Coleanthus subtilis and Limosella aquatica, whereas fruits of Littorella uniflora were buoyant for a few days only and were not able to rise to the water surface when water level was rising. After flooding of a pond with established vegetation at the pond bottom, many seeds could be sampled by scooping the water body and water surface, especially during the first 7 weeks after flooding started. In addition, seeds of Coleanthus subtilis and Limosella aquatica were found in sediments of ditches and trenches. They were transported for about 14 km, indicating a high potential for hydrochory within the Erzgebirge region. This is also the case for a set of other character species and satellite species of dwarf rush vegetation for which many seeds could be found in the sediments of the trenches. Overall the results document a high buoyancy ability for seeds of Coleanthus subtilis and Limosella aquatica. Thus, both species are able to disperse over long distances via the water system. However, hydrochory alone cannot explain the supra-regional distribution pattern. In contrast to these two species Littorella uniflora has fruits with very limited buoyancy, which could not be detected in the sediments of the trenches. This suggests that hydrochory as generative dispersal mechanism is not important for this species, especially for long-distance dispersal.																	0722-494X						2011		31					87	104									WOS:000295349800007						
J	Kurtz, C; Heinken, T				Kurtz, Christine; Heinken, Thilo			Seed-bank analysis to detect endangered weed species on former arable fields: seedling-emergence method versus seed-bank activation in the field	TUEXENIA												Seed-bank analysis to detect endangered weed species on former arable fields: seedling-emergence method versus seed-bank activation in the field Within the DBU-project "100 Acker fur die Vielfalt", for the protection of native weed communities, seven potential sites of "conservation fields" were studied in Eastern Brandenburg (Germany). These were fallow fields or grasslands which had not been used as arable fields for 2, 20 or 50 years. On the sites on slopes with sandy to loamy soils, which were partly rich in bases and calcium carbonate, endangered weed species like Agrostemma githago, Arnoseris minima, Nigella arvensis, and Stachys annua have been observed during former periods of agriculture. To test whether these plant species are still present in the seed bank, soil samples were taken in three plots per site and the seed bank was analysed using the seedling-emergence method in trays in a common garden. In a second approach seed-bank activation in the field the soil was ploughed on 16-m(2) plots where the soil samples had been taken. Until now, only very few studies have compared these two methods. On the ploughed sites between 21 and 47 weed species, including seven of the eight endangered target species, were detected even after long-lasting abandonment. However, it is doubtful whether the seeds of all detected species originated from the last period of cultivation. Single occurrences in vegetation gaps or rooting places of wild boar suggest that some weed species have been able to survive in small populations. Using the seedling-emergence method mainly abundant, not endangered plant species were detected. The percentage of therophytes was higher in the seedling-emergence study than in the field approach (mean 53% vs. 45%). Here only two thirds of the species detected in the field approach have been found (108 vs. 152). However, some species appeared only in the seedling-emergence experiment, probably due to different microclimatic and soil conditions during the trial. For the detection of rare species, the field approach is generally more appropriate, since the seed bank is activated on a relatively large area and thus the probability of detecting even rare species is much higher. Moreover, the low probability of finding certain species using the seedling-emergence method results from the spatial variability of the seed distribution in the soil, since most seeds are deposited close to the mother plant. This, together with small-scale heterogeneity of site conditions, also accounts for the differences in species composition between the two methods. As some of the studied sites are currently developing into species-rich dry grasslands, we do not recommend resuming utilization as arable fields. However, small-scale ploughing may support target species of both habitat types and thus enhance plant species diversity.																	0722-494X						2011		31					105	126									WOS:000295349800008

These wetland sites (partly former fens) had been drained with subsequent mineralization of peat. We ran topsoil removal experiments to decrease nutrient values in the topsoil layer and to detect the optimal hydrological conditions for Cirso-Molinietum species. As target area we used the nature protection area "Monchbruch" (south of Frankfurt / Main) with extensive stands, e.g., of the Cirsio-Molinietum. In this pilot study we analysed germination, establishment, and vitality of four target species (Carex tomentosa, Cirsium tuberosum, Galium wirtgenii and Linum catharticum) from 2006 to 2009. We ran a field experiment with a gradient of soil removal between 25 cm and 100 cm depth with addition of seeds of these target species. Besides these species, we analysed the floristic structure of the spontaneous vegetation and the establishment of a seed bank. Additionally, we used a second site to study topsoil removal of 10 cm. While target-species germination and establishment rates were both low at a soil removal depth of 10 cm, they were high at 25-40 cm depth. Carex tomentosa was not able to germinate and establish in the dryer parts of the gradient, whereas too-wet conditions with long, persistent watering were not tolerated by Galium wirtgenii and Linum catharticum. Cirsium tuberosum occupied an intermediate position. An optimal establishment rate and vitality of the four target species was attained between 25 and 40 cm soil removal depth. In the course of our four-year study we documented the spread of the target species as well as the beginning of the establishment of a seed bank. Meanwhile many of the former riverbed stands are grazed (partly in a mixed grazing-/ mowing system). Therefore, we asked if an establishment after endozoochorous dispersal by sheep is possible. In this second experiment, sheep were fed seeds of three target species (Carex tomentosa, Galium wirtgenii, Linum catharticum). Only Galium wirtgenii clearly germinated and established successfully. For Linum catharticum we were not able to exclude secondary inoculation. At least for Galium, sheep may play a role as vectors for diaspore transport between the areas. Further investigations will analyse the possible establishment of the Cirsio-Molinietum after inoculation with mown material of this community.																	0722-494X						2011		31					127	151									WOS:000295349800009

A Paleoecological Perspective on Wetland Restoration	WETLANDS: INTEGRATING MULTIDISCIPLINARY CONCEPTS												Paleoecological investigations of wetland sedimentary deposits offer the possibility of obtaining accurate reconstructions of base line conditions in the past. Plant remains, such as leaves, seeds, fruits, wood, and pollen, provide a window of variable temporal and spatial resolution into past environmental conditions at a particular site. These archives of physical and biological wetland ecosystem characteristics, if preserved, may be exploited to reconstruct the plant community at a single point in time. Moreover, changes in past plant community composition, hydrology, and the dynamics of wetland ecosystems through time may be better understood. This paper reviews the range of paleoecological information archived in wetland sedimentary deposits that may be understood in the restoration science context. This type of information gleaned by applying paleoecological techniques should provide reasonable targets for restoration ecologists working to improve the quality and quantity of ecosystem functions and services in wetlands.

Conserving Australia's Unique Rainforest Fruits and Wild Relatives	XXVIII INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS ON SCIENCE AND HORTICULTURE FOR PEOPLE (IHC2010): III INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES	Acta Horticulturae				28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People/3rd International Symposium on Plant Genetic Resources	AUG 22-27, 2010	Lisbon, PORTUGAL					Australian rainforests have many unique edible fruits including wild relatives of worldwide economically important species such as citrus and macadamia. One of the key risks of projected climate change is its effect on Eastern Australian rainforests. The interaction of climate change with other threats, such as weeds and habitat fragmentation, is thus likely to impact on already vulnerable environments such as the World Heritage listed Gondwana Rainforests of S. Queensland and N. New South Wales. Seed banking is a cost effective way of conserving unique and vulnerable diversity ex situ for utilisation (e.g., plant breeding and restoration programs). However, the seeds of many rainforest species cannot survive the desiccation required in standard seed banking procedures (i.e., non-orthodox seed storage characteristics). This paper reports on preliminary findings on biology and storage characteristics of seeds of 11 significant and/or threatened Australian rainforest fruits. Of these, 4 were desiccation sensitive (DS) and living collections and technology development (e.g., cryopreservation) needs to be prioritised for ex situ conservation. Of the 7 desiccation tolerant (DT) seeds, only one is expected to be viable in long-term storage by standard seedbanking methods. The oil content and thermal analysis of oils is described for 5 of these species and indicates the need to investigate alternative storage, particularly cryopreservation, for these species.																	0567-7572		978-90-66055-54-4				2011	918						51	58									WOS:000313331500004

Storage Stability Using Cryopreservation: a Case Study in Papaya	XXVIII INTERNATIONAL HORTICULTURAL CONGRESS ON SCIENCE AND HORTICULTURE FOR PEOPLE (IHC2010): III INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PLANT GENETIC RESOURCES	Acta Horticulturae				28th International Horticultural Congress on Science and Horticulture for People/3rd International Symposium on Plant Genetic Resources	AUG 22-27, 2010	Lisbon, PORTUGAL					Ex situ conservation of Carica papaya and its crop wild relatives has been the subject of ten years of research in our laboratory. This paper summarises the achievements and key findings of this work. Both clonal and seed materials have been investigated to allow storage of elite clonal material as well as maximum genetic diversity. Clonal material from several genotypes has been successfully stored using micropropagation followed by shoot tip cryopreservation, with >70% regeneration after 12 months storage in LN. The regeneration and acclimatisation of cryopreserved plants has been achieved for field testing and observations of morphological characteristics, including flowering and fruiting, have not detected any changes associated with cryopreservation. Genetic stability following shoot tip cryopreservation has also been monitored using both RAF (Random Amplified DNA Fingerprinting) and AMP (Amplified DNA Methylation Polymorphism) techniques. Whilst both RAF and AMP changes were observed following cryopreservation, these were not associated with cryopreservation per se and did not correlate with any modification in plant morphology. Investigations of papaya seed storage indicate that seed is essentially orthodox, but dormancy breaking treatments were required for germination. However, germination post storage for 12 months was >68% at ultra-low temperatures (LN), but <5% at conventional seed storage temperatures (-20 degrees C). This is in line with recent evidence that cryopreservation enhances storage stability and longevity, even in orthodox seeds, when compared with standard seed bank approaches. This highlights the importance of cryopreservation for the long-term management of genetic resources of both clonal and seed genetic resources of papaya.																	0567-7572		978-90-66055-54-4				2011	918						125	130									WOS:000313331500014						
J	Cordeau, S; Reboud, X; Chauvel, B				Cordeau, Stephane; Reboud, Xavier; Chauvel, Bruno			Relative importance of farming practices and landscape context on the weed flora of sown grass strips	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												The floristic composition of 62 sown grass strips located in two study areas was assessed over a 2-year period and related to 12 variables describing farming practices, spatial variability and the landscape context. Differences in the composition of the weed communities were greater between the two study areas than between the 2 years. For sites 1 and 2 respectively, the factors that structured the species assemblage were landscape context (32.7% vs. 34.8%), sown grass strip management (29.4% vs. 34.8%), spatial variability (31.5% vs. 26.1%) and practices in the adjacent field (19.9% vs. 19.3%). Variability between sown-grass-strip floras was higher than variation within sown-grass-strip floras. However, the part of the sown grass strip adjacent to the boundary showed higher species richness and diversity. High species richness was due to the contribution of species unique to the boundary side. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Application of design theory for restoring the "black beach" degraded rangeland at the headwater areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												Severe degradation of alpine rangeland into the "black beach" at the headwater areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau driven by human disturbance and climatic change is limiting the sustainable development of ecological, social and economic systems in both local and downstream regions. Appropriate restoration theory is needed to guide the technical and managerial strategies to restore the degraded alpine rangeland and maintain the upstream-downstream relationships in the ecological web. A ten-year research program of restoring the "black-beach" degraded rangelands at the headwater areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was summarized in this study to clarify the restoration theory guiding the interventions for rehabilitating these rangelands and provide some examples of successful rehabilitations for worldwide alpine rangeland ecosystems. It was found that the design theory was more applicable than the self-design theory in guiding the restoration interventions for "black-beach" degraded rangeland. Replanting guided by the design theory was effective in reconstructing the alpine rangeland vegetation and improving the ecological and economic values of the alpine rangeland ecosystem at the headwater areas of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Seed rain, seed bank and seedling germination should be included in post-restoration monitoring and assessment of restoration practices.																	1991-637X					DEC	2010	5	25					3542	3552									WOS:000286634600004

Glyphosate drift promotes changes in fitness and transgene gene flow in canola (Brassica napus) and hybrids	ANNALS OF BOTANY												With the advent of transgenic crops, genetically modified, herbicide-resistant Brassica napus has become a model system for examining the risks and potential ecological consequences of escape of transgenes from cultivation into wild compatible species. Escaped transgenic feral B. napus and hybrids with compatible weedy species have been identified outside of agriculture and without the apparent selection for herbicide resistance. However, herbicide (glyphosate) exposure can extend beyond crop field boundaries, and a drift-level of herbicide could function as a selective agent contributing to increased persistence of transgenes in the environment. The effects of a drift level (0 center dot 1 x the field application rate) of glyphosate herbicide and varied levels of plant competition were examined on plant fitness-associated traits and gene flow in a simulated field plot, common garden experiment. Plants included transgenic, glyphosate-resistant B. napus, its weedy ancestor B. rapa, and hybrid and advanced generations derived from them. The results of this experiment demonstrate reductions in reproductive fitness for non-transgenic genotypes and a contrasting increase in plant fitness for transgenic genotypes as a result of glyphosate-drift treatments. Results also suggest that a drift level of glyphosate spray may influence the movement of transgenes among transgenic crops and weeds and alter the processes of hybridization and introgression in non-agronomic habitats by impacting flowering phenology and pollen availability within the community. The results of this study demonstrate the potential for persistence of glyphosate resistance transgenes in weedy plant communities due to the effect of glyphosate spray drift on plant fitness. Additionally, glyphosate drift has the potential to change the gene-flow dynamics between compatible transgenic crops and weeds, simultaneously reducing direct introgression into weedy species while contributing to an increase in the transgenic seed bank.

Secondary seed dispersal of Erodiophyllum elderi, a patchily distributed short-lived perennial in the arid lands of Australia	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												We investigated secondary dispersal of propagules of Erodiophyllum elderi (Asteraceae), a short-lived perennial plant growing in small patches in the arid lands of southern Australia. In spite of its importance for population dynamics, secondary dispersal is a little understood process. We monitored the dispersal of 2280 large woody capitula (seed heads) released in six E. elderi patches for 9 months. Colour-coded seed heads were located at night using UV light and their distance and direction from the release point were measured. Over the 9-month period, more seed heads moved, and those that did, moved further in areas with high herbivore activity. Overall dispersal distance across the ground was limited to less than 30 m. Dispersal patterns were related to the topographical slope at the release site: seed heads moved further, and more dispersed on steeper slopes unless the steep slopes had sandy soil in which case seed heads were buried, caught or there was reduced sheet water flow limiting their dispersal potential. After several months, seed head dispersal virtually ceased as seed heads became stuck in the debris and soil after heavy rains or further dispersal became unlikely when seed heads reached locally low-lying areas. Secondary dispersal patterns suggest two distinctly different influences associated with the presence of herbivores: the direct movement of seed heads by trampling from sheep (an introduced herbivore) and the indirect effect of a reduced standing biomass from grazing. Reduced vegetation cover allows seed head redistribution via sheet water flow during large rainfall events.

A long-term study on the vegetation successional dynamics of the area was launched immediately after the 2005 event. Relev, plots were established under five different disturbance and management treatments: windthrow left, windthrow removed, hydrologically managed, burnt and reference. We used weighted Ellenberg's indicator plant values for ordination analyses of the following environmental gradients: light, temperature, continentality, moisture, acidity, nitrogen. Successional patterns depended on the management treatment. Heavily burnt areas were colonized by plants disseminated by airborn diasporas, mainly by Chamaerion angustifolium, less burnt or unburnt localities were settled by plants germinating from the soil seed bank or by plants surviving by root system. Nitrophilous weed vegetation invaded plots with increased moisture (fallen or standing overstory vegetation or irrigated by man-made system) and nitrogen (burnt or windthrow removal). The felled-area species were recorded in each plot. Abundant natural regeneration was observed in plots with increased moisture. The moss layer disappeared soon after the disturbance events. The results presented here refer to a very early successional stage, new insights into initial successional paterns are gained.																	0006-3088	1336-9563				DEC	2010	65	6					958	964		10.2478/s11756-010-0110-y							WOS:000283078000006

In this article we investigate the succession of methanotrophs in oxygen-methane counter-gradients. We used a gradient microcosm system that simulates oxic-anoxic interfaces of a water-saturated paddy soils, and measured pmoA-based (gene encoding particulate methane monooxygenase) terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiles at both the transcription (mRNA) and the population (DNA) levels. The DNA T-RFLP profiles indicated that the methanotrophic community present clearly differed from the active methanotrophic community. We observed a succession of the methanotrophic community over time without any direct effect of pore water chemistry on the community structure. Both the total population and the active subpopulation changed with time, whereas methane oxidation rates remained nearly constant. Hence, we suggest that a diverse microbial seed bank of methanotrophs is important in maintaining the function in a dynamic ecosystem.

The review analyses more than one hundred papers regarding forests, agriculture and water resources. Its aim is to be used as a basis for supporting future research and long-term mitigation and adaptation planning. Mitigation possibilities are mainly focused on producing energy from renewable resources, reducing CO, emissions from fossil fuels and using biomass specifically produced or different types of wastes. Other mitigation strategies are contrasting or governing land use changes or sequestring C into the soil. Adaptation to climate change will need anthropic intervention, to help the adapting capability of different environments. Most of the papers reviewed underline the need to act immediately to have the desired results, and to take into account, during the design of the strategy, the society and the local authorities, which may be able to help at identifying the vulnerabilities and the appropriate measures for each region.																	2038-5625					DEC	2010	15	3					21	42									WOS:000208680600003						
J	Stokes, K; Ward, K; Colloff, M				Stokes, Kate; Ward, Keith; Colloff, Matthew			Alterations in flood frequency increase exotic and native species richness of understorey vegetation in a temperate floodplain eucalypt forest	PLANT ECOLOGY												The delivery of environmental flows for biodiversity benefits within regulated river systems can potentially contribute to exotic weed spread. This study explores whether exotic plants of a floodplain forest in Victoria, Australia, are characterised by specific functional groups and associated plant traits linked to altering hydrological conditions over time. Permanently marked 20 x 20 m(2) plots from five wetland sites in Eucalyptus camaldulensis floodplain forest were sampled twice, first in the early 1990s (1993-1994) and then 15 years later (2007-2008). Species cover abundance data for understorey vegetation communities were segregated by season and analysed using ordination analysis. Exotic species richness was modelled as a function of site flooding history and native species richness using general linear models. Site ordinations by detrended correspondence analysis showed differential community compositions between survey dates, but native and exotic species were not clearly differentiated in terms of DCA1 scores. Most exotics belonged to functional groups containing annual species that germinate and reproduce under drier conditions. Exotics reproducing under wetter conditions were in the minority, predominantly perennial and capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction. Site flooding history and native species richness significantly predicted exotic species richness. Vegetation changes are partially structured by reduced flood frequency favouring increased abundance of exotic, sexually reproducing annuals at drier sites. Sites of low flood frequency are more sensitive to future exotic weed invasion and will require targeted management effort. Flow restoration is predicted to benefit propagule dispersal of species adopting dual regeneration strategies, which are predominantly natives in this system.

Using population viability analysis to predict the effect of fire on the extinction risk of an endangered shrub Verticordia fimbrilepis subsp fimbrilepis in a fragmented landscape	PLANT ECOLOGY												The fragmentation of mediterranean climate landscapes where fire is an important landscape process may lead to unsuitable fire regimes for many species, particularly rare species that occur as small isolated populations. We investigate the influence of fire interval on the persistence of population fragments of the endangered shrub Verticordia fimbrilepis Turcz. subsp. fimbrilepis in mediterranean climate south-west of Western Australia. We studied the population biology of the species over 5 years. While the species does recruit sporadically without fire this occurs only in years with above average rainfall, so fire seems to be the main environmental factor producing extensive recruitment. Transition matrix models were constructed to describe the shrub's population dynamics. As the species is killed by fire and relies on a seed bank stimulated to germinate by smoke, stochastic simulations to compare different fire frequencies on population viability were completed. Extinction risk increased with increasing average fire interval. Initial population size was also important, with the lowest extinction risk in the largest population. For populations in small reserves where fire is generally excluded, inevitable plant senescence will lead to local extirpation unless fires of suitable frequency can be used to stimulate regeneration. While a suitable fire regime reduces extinction risk small populations are still prone to extinction due to stochastic influences, and this will be exacerbated by a projected drying climate increasing rates of adult mortality and also seedling mortality in the post-fire environment.

M.; Ceccon, Eliane			Young restored forests increase seedling recruitment in abandoned pastures in the Southern Atlantic rainforest	REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL												Planting seedlings is a common technique for abandoned pastures restoration in the tropics, supposedly by increasing the seedling recruitment and accelerating succession. In this study we evaluated the role of a young restored forest (one year old) in enhancing seedling establishment from two sources (seed rain and seed bank), in the Atlantic Rainforest region in Southern Brazil. We compared abandoned pasture, young restored forest and old-growth forest with respect to the seedlings recruited from different sources, by monitoring 40 permanent plots (0.5mx0.5m) over 20 months. From the three studied areas a total of 392 seedlings of 53 species were recruited. Species were mainly herbaceous (85%), pioneers (88%), zoochorous (51%) and small-seeded species (60%). Seedling recruitment from the seed bank (density and species richness) was higher and dominated by herbaceous species in the abandoned pasture and in the young restored forest; on the other hand, the recruitment of woody species from seed rain was more pronounced in the old-growth forest. The young restored forest increased the species richness of woody seedlings recruitment from the seed bank (two-fold) and from seed rain (three-fold) compared to the abandoned pasture. Also, the seedling density in young restored forest was still higher than abandoned pastures (seed bank: four times; seed rain: ten times). Our results show that even young restored areas enhance the establishment of woody species and should be considered an important step for pasture restoration. Rev. Biol. Trop. 58 (4): 1271-1282.

In these models, seed mortality in the soil is a key parameter to account for the cumulated effect of cropping systems over time via the soil seed-bank. Since seed mortality is difficult to measure, our objective was to develop a method to estimate it from easily accessible information. Seeds of 13 weed species were buried 30cm deep in fields and were recovered regularly for 2 years to measure their viability. Seed mass, dimensions, shape, and protein and lipid contents as well as coat thickness were measured. To estimate seed mortality of species not included in the study, we searched for relationships between mortality rates and seed traits. Seed viability mainly decreased during the second year of burial, with mortality rates ranging from 0.01 to 0.63 seeds.seeds(-1).year 21, depending on the species. Seed mortality decreased with increasing seed coat thickness. No correlation was found with other measured traits or with seed persistence data in the literature. These results were confirmed when the effects of phylogenetic relatedness with phylogenetically independent contrasts were included. The thickness of the seed coat, which varied between 17 and 231 mm over the range of species studied, can protect the seed from external attacks in the soil and slow down seed decay. This trait can be easily measured via X-ray images and could be used to estimate the seed mortality rate for a wider range of species.

We surveyed the weed abundance and weed seed banks in the soil of paddy fields with inferred differences in their water regime in 22 farm fields in three provinces of Cambodia in the 2005 and 2006 rainy seasons. We studied rain-fed lowland fields in upslope and downslope topographic positions and fields at different distances from the irrigation water source inside an irrigation rehabilitation area. The weed seed banks were estimated by seedling emergence in small containers and weed abundance and vigor were estimated by a simple scoring system. The estimated weed seed bank in the top 5 cm of soil ranged from 52.1 to 167 x 103 seeds m-2 (overall mean of 8.5 x 103 seeds m-2) and contained a high proportion (86%) of sedge species, such as Fimbristylis miliacea L. and Cyperus difformis. Several fields had particularly large seed banks, including one near the reservoir. No clear difference was found in the weed seed banks between the irrigated fields that were located close to (upstream) and distant from (downstream) the water source or between the irrigated and rain-fed lowland fields, but the weed scores were larger in the rain-fed fields and the downstream fields within the irrigated area. A water shortage during the late growing season in 2005 led to a proliferation of weeds in some fields and an associated increase in weed seedbank size in 2006. However, the weed scores in 2006 were more strongly associated with that year's water conditions than with the weed seedbank size.																	1444-6162					DEC	2010	10	4					261	272		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2010.00393.x							WOS:000285390000008

Post-dispersal predation of weed seeds in rice fields	WEED RESEARCH												P>Post-dispersal weed seed predation can cause a substantial reduction in the number of weed seeds entering the seed bank and, as a consequence, reduce the number of weeds growing in subsequent seasons. Investigations on seed predation on four tropical rice fields in the Philippines were conducted to determine (i) the magnitude of post-dispersal seed predation after rice harvest, (ii) whether vertebrates or invertebrates are the main seed predators, (iii) whether seed predation is affected by crop residue, (iv) whether seed predation is affected by proximity to the field edge, and (v) whether predation differs among seeds of the grasses Digitaria ciliaris, Echinochloa colona and Eleusine indica. Seed removal rate over a 14-day period ranged from 78% to 91% among fields, was slightly higher in the interior of the fields (89%) than in the field margins (85%) and slightly higher without residue cover (89%) than with (86%). Selective exclosures indicated that invertebrates, presumed to be mainly fire ants (Solenopsis geminata), were the main seed predators (96%) and vertebrates, presumed to be mainly rodents, secondary predators (38%). Seed removal of D. ciliaris was higher (93%) than of E. indica (88%) and E. colona (75%). Results suggest substantial seed predation could contribute to ecologically-based weed management in rice. Further studies are required to determine season-long seed predation rates and to confirm the identity of the predators involved. Ways to integrate these seed predators into prevailing cropping practices need to be developed.

Beauv site, in an abandoned pasture of the Mata do Paraiso Forest Reserve, Vicosa, MG. Ten parcels had been placed in each successional site of forest and withdrawals of the center of each parcel sample of 1 m(2) and 5 cm of superficial depth of soil, being carried afterwards to the abandoned pasture site. Two hundred and thirty one individuals had been registered in the two treatments (initial forest and mature forest), consisting of 31 shrubs and 200 trees. The individuals are distributed by 13 families, 17 kinds and 22 species. The most abundant species had been Vernonia polyanthes, with 108 individuals and Senna multijuga, with 39 individuals. The soil seed bank coming from the site of initial secondary forest (Fi) registered more individuals (120) than the bank coming from the site of the mature forest (Fm), with 111 individuals. The parcels witnesses had been colonized by herbaceous and mainly by the exotic grass Melinis Minutiflora. The number of germinated seeds was only greater in the Fm treatment in the months of july/2008 and january/2009. Significant differences were observed with 1% probability, between the treatments, for the variable wealth of species and density of individuals. The present study showed that it is recommendable and viable to adopt the technique of transposition of the seed bank as a methodology of forest restoration of abandoned pasture.

J	Gazol, A; Ibanez, R				Gazol, Antonio; Ibanez, Ricardo			Plant species composition in a temperate forest: Multi-scale patterns and determinants	ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We examine the spatial patterns of plant species composition at different scales in a hierarchical sampling design with two surveys of contrasting scale. Additionally, environmental and spatial variables are used to explain the observed patterns. Five datasets were analyzed in this study. The first was obtained as a result of a large-scale spatial survey, in which the study site (132 ha) was divided into 102 large plots of 20 x 20 m. The remaining four datasets were obtained from a small-scale spatial survey, in which four of the former plots were also divided into 100 small plots of 2 x 2 m. Spatial patterns of plant species composition in both spatial surveys were quantified and the factors that influenced them were assessed using multi-scale pattern analysis (MSPA). Over the large-scale survey the topographic structure of the study site created a spatially structured environment, influencing species composition, and the spatial variables indicated that the environment was structured at a broad scale (relative to grain size and extent of the survey). In the small-scale survey the microenvironmental variables that influenced species composition were also spatially structured at a broad scale (relative to grain size and extent of the survey). However, the analyses point to the existence of spatial autocorrelation that seems to be structured at finer scales than the environmental heterogeneity in both study surveys. This study indicates that species composition in this temperate forest is not only determined by the environmental variables studied at either of the two spatial scales considered (large- and small-scale surveys). In both scales, the pure spatial component present in the analyses may be indicating the influence of unmeasured environmental variables and/or biotic processes on species composition patterns. However, while environmental heterogeneity has a broad-scale domain, biotic processes seem to work at finer scales, as is indicated by the spatial predictors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Topsoil Seed Bank of an Oak-Hickory Forest in Eastern Kentucky as a Restoration Tool on Surface Mines	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Typical reclamation practices in the central Appalachian coal region often use compacted spoils as a topsoil replacement, and these soils are revegetated with aggressive grasses and legumes. This restoration approach results in an herbaceous-dominated landscape with limited natural succession by native flora. An alternative restoration method is to save topsoil prior to mining, stockpile it during mining, and then replace it on uncompacted spoils to "inoculate" the site with native plant species. In an effort to test this approach, vegetation assessments were performed at a relatively undisturbed forested site in Clay County, Kentucky, U.S.A. Eight 15 x 15-m plots were established, and soils from individual plots were used in seed bank studies both in the greenhouse and on loose-dumped mine spoils. Bulk soil samples were removed from the plots and subjected to cold stratification for 13 weeks, after which seeds were allowed to germinate under greenhouse conditions for 1 year. Additional topsoil (approximately 1.5 m3 from the upper 0-20 cm) was removed from the plots and replaced on fresh spoil in eight 2 x 5-m plots. Controls consisted of uncompacted spoil material substrate only. A total of 105 species emerged in the greenhouse from the seed bank. On the relocated topsoil, 69 species were recorded of which 39 were also observed in pre-mine vegetation surveys. Ten of the 17 most important pre-mine forested site species emerged from the relocated topsoil treatments on the mine site. Our results indicate that application of topsoil could enhance plant diversity and native species reestablishment on surface-mined lands.					, Christopher/0000-0003-0692-3079												1061-2971	1526-100X				NOV	2010	18	6					834	842		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00509.x							WOS:000283718000007

We carried out a full factorial experiment with all combinations of these factors and monitored it for 4 years. We studied the effect of seed availability in the soil seed bank on species abundance in the vegetation and compared it to the effect of species introduction by hay. We observed large differences in species composition between different treatments after 4 years. The combination of hay transfer, deep soil removal, and exclusion of large animals resulted in a community with highest similarity to the target vegetation. We found that the transfer of seeds with hay had a larger effect on species abundance than the soil seed bank. Hay transfer appeared to have important consequences on vegetation development because it speeded up the establishment of the target vegetation.

SEED ECOLOGY OF AN INVASIVE ALIEN SPECIES, ACACIA LONGIFOLIA (FABACEAE), IN PORTUGUESE DUNE ECOSYSTEMS	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Premise of the study: Worldwide, invasive plants threaten biodiversity, by disrupting habitats and ecosystem processes, and cause major economic losses. Invasiveness in plants is frequently associated with prolific production of seeds that accumulate in the soil. Knowledge of the extent and persistence of invasive seed banks helps explain invasion processes and enables management planning. A study of Acacia longifolia, an invasive species in Portuguese dune ecosystems, provides an informative example. Methods: Seed rain and dispersal (seed traps), the persistence of seeds in the soil (burial), and the extent of seed banks were measured and analyzed. Key results: Seed rain is concentrated under the canopy with about 12 000 seeds . m(-2) falling annually. The number of seeds in the soil declined with time, with only 30% surviving after 75 mo. Losses were lowest at greater depths. Seed germinability was low (<12%), but viability was high (>85%) for surviving seeds. The seed bank under the canopy was approximately 1500 and 500 seeds . m(-2) in long- and recently invaded stands, respectively. Some seeds were found up to 7 m from the edge of stands, indicating that outside agencies facilitate dispersal. Conclusions: Acacia longifolia produces large numbers of seeds, some of which are lost through germination, decay, and granivory. The remainder form vast and persistent seed banks that serve as a source of replenishment and make it difficult to control the invader once it is established. Control costs escalate as the duration of an invasion increases, highlighting the urgency of initiating and persevering with control efforts.

Pre-zygotic parental environment modulates seed longevity	AUSTRAL ECOLOGY												The potential for the pre-zygotic plant growth environment to play a role in determining seed longevity was investigated for a species that inhabits arid to semi-arid Australia. Seed longevity is particularly important for wild populations in fluctuating environments because the longer a seed-lot is able to survive in the soil seed bank the more likely it is to buffer the population from unpredictable environments. Thus Wahlenbergia tumidifructa plants received wet or dry soil moisture within a warm or cool glasshouse until flowering. Seeds subsequently produced by flowers that opened on the day that plants were moved to a common environment were collected at maturity and longevity assessed by controlled ageing at 60% relative humidity and 45 degrees C. Mean seed longevity was similar for seeds produced by plants that grew in warm-wet, warm-dry and cool-dry conditions (P(50) of about 20 days), but extended for plants in cool-wet conditions (P(50) = 41.7 days). Cool temperatures resulted in seeds with a wider distribution of lifespans (sigma = 20 days) than warm conditions (sigma = 12 days); the large sigma caused the extended P(50) for cool-wet plants, but not cool-dry as a result of a concomitant reduction in initial seed germination (K(i)). After moving to the common environment, all plants generated new vegetative material, which went on to produce seeds with similar longevity (P(50) approx. 20 days) irrespective of original environment. Visible phenotypic responses of the parent to environmental conditions correlated with longevity and quality parameters of the progeny seeds, suggesting that a parental effect modified seed longevity. Our study provides novel empirical data showing that environmental conditions expected under climate change scenarios may potentially cause seed longevity to decline for a species that inhabits arid to semi-arid Australia. These negative impacts on population buffering may weaken the storage effect mechanism of species coexistence in fluctuating environments.

Effects of plant competition, seed predation, and nutrient limitation on seedling survivorship of spotted knapweed (Centaurea stoebe)	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												We measured seed germination and seedling survivorship of spotted knapweed, Centaurea stoebe, in a series of laboratory and field experiments to evaluate the efficacy of seed limitation as a management focus. This work was initiated 6 years after introduction of several biological control agents. The soil seed bank of the site used in this study contained a mean density of 5,848 seeds/m(2) (ranging from 0 to 16,364 seeds/m(2)), and 92% of the seeds isolated from soils were shriveled, discolored, and/or partially decayed. Additionally, none of the intact seeds germinated, suggesting that the viable seed bank at our field study site has been exhausted. Centaurea stoebe seeds were planted into pots under a range of soil nitrogen (N) availability, with half of the pots containing a single density of previously established seedlings of a native cool-season grass, slender wheatgrass (Elymus trachycaulus). A watering regime mimicking local precipitation was applied. Spotted knapweed exhibited large biomass responses to N addition, but the presence of grasses suppressed the ability to exploit this N. Surprisingly, low soil N conditions improved knapweed survivorship in the presence of grasses. Nevertheless, recruitment and biomass were still far below the levels reached in the absence of competition. To evaluate the effect of density on successful recruitment, Centaurea stoebe seed was introduced into a meadow at three densities matching reduced levels of seed production under the constraints of seed predators. These densities were sown with or without a seed mixture of native species, into an existing plant community lacking C. stoebe, and seedling recruitment was recorded over 2.5 years. Across all plots and densities sown (568-2,272 seeds m(-2) year(-1)), seedling recruitment was less than 1%. The invasion potential of spotted knapweed was greatly diminished when realistic levels of plant competition and biological control limit seed production. We therefore conclude that a combination of seed limitation and shortage of 'safe sites' within undisturbed vegetation can limit densities of C. stoebe.

Volunteer adzuki bean within a corn crop can decrease corn yield and increase the adzuki bean seed bank. The objective of this research was to evaluate the efficacy of various preemergence (PRE) and postemergence (POST) herbicides for the control of volunteer adzuki bean [Vigna angularis (Willd.) Ohwi & Ohashi] in corn. Trials were conducted at two locations in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009. Experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block design with either seven PRE or ten POST herbicides. Volunteer adzuki bean interference resulted in corn yield losses of 16 to 43%. The PRE herbicides provided variable control. The highest and most consistent control PRE was provided by dicamba/atrazine, which provided 69 to 97% control of volunteer adzuki bean at 4 and 8 wk after emergence (WAE), respectively. Dicamba/atrazine PRE reduced volunteer adzuki bean density and biomass 67 to 97% 10 WAE. Generally, the POST herbicides evaluated provided better and more consistent control of volunteer adzuki bean than the PRE herbicides. Dicamba/atrazine applied POST provided greater than 95% control of volunteer adzuki bean and consistently reduced volunteer adzuki bean density and biomass to the equivalent of the weed-free control. Dicamba/atrazine applied POST resulted in corn yields equivalent to the weed-free control. The best option for controlling volunteer adzuki bean in corn is to apply dicamba/atrazine POST, while the remaining herbicides evaluated provided variable control.

J	Endresen, DTF				Endresen, Dag Terje Filip			Predictive Association between Trait Data and Ecogeographic Data for Nordic Barley Landraces	CROP SCIENCE												Focused Identification of Germplasm (FIGS) is a new method to select plant genetic resources for the improvement of food crops. Traditional cultivars (landraces) and crop wild relatives (CWR) provide a valuable source for novel alleles in crop improvement programs, but conserved landraces and CWR often lack important documentation. Genebank collections worldwide provide ready access to plant genetic resources including online documentation. However, incomplete documentation, and in particular the lack of relevant characterization and evaluation data (traits), often limit the efficient use of plant genetic resources. This current study demonstrates how trait mining with the new FIGS method can be used to predict missing trait information for landraces. Ecogeographic data from the location of origin for 14 Nordic landraces of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was successfully correlated to morphological traits using a modern multilinear data modeling method (multilinear partial least squares [N-PLS]). This result suggests that trait mining can efficiently be used as a targeted germplasm selection method and complement or replace the current core selection method in situations when the requirements for the trait mining method are fulfilled.

This study addressed two questions regarding the role of temporary pools in supporting diversity of riparian vegetation in a regulated river in Japan: (1) do temporary pools maintain high native riparian plant species diversity? And, (2) how do physical environmental factors affect the pattern of plant species distribution? The study was conducted on a 1-km section of the Hayade River alluvial fan in Niigata Prefecture, central Japan. Two to five transect belts consisting of 20 contiguous plots (1 m x 1 m) were laid out in two off-channel temporary pools and six other sites classified by physiognomy. Vascular plant presence, relative elevation, and substratum type were recorded in all plots. Species richness, Simpson's reciprocal index (1/D), and Shannon-Wiener function (H') were calculated by life form to estimate plant species diversity. Two conclusions could be drawn from the results. First, the temporary pools maintained high native riparian plant species diversity in this regulated river floodplain. Second, several environmental factors (seasonal wet-dry cycle, low elevation, complex micro-topography, and fine substrata) created spatial and seasonal heterogeneity of moisture conditions in the temporary pools, supporting plant species diversity. For sustainable maintenance of riparian plant species diversity, progressive river-management should restore original riverine dynamics to generate a shifting mosaic of diverse geomorphology.																	0912-3814					NOV	2010	25	6					1045	1055		10.1007/s11284-010-0731-1							WOS:000284422200001

The role of the soil seed and seedling bank in the regeneration of diverse plant communities in the subtropical Ailao Mountains, Southwest China	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												We compared species composition and diversity of the soil seed and seedling banks in three secondary vegetation types (shrubland, Populus bonatii forest, Lithocarpus regrowth forest) and a primary old-growth forest in the subtropical Ailao Mountains of southwestern China to clarify the importance of seed and seedling banks for forest dynamics. The average species richness was the highest in soil samples from the shrubland (26.80 +/- A 1.98), and the lowest from the primary forest (9.93 +/- A 0.50). The density of germinable tree seeds increased from the secondary vegetation to the primary forest, and the density of shrub, forb, and graminoid seeds decreased significantly. The most abundant seedlings recorded in soil samples were light-demanding species in the shrubland and Populus bonatii forest. For ground flora, the number of shrub seedlings strongly decreased with the increase in stand age, and shade-tolerant tree seedlings tended to increase. The species similarity between the seed bank and the aboveground vegetation in all sites was low (Sorensen's index = 0.11-0.33), however, the shrubland had higher similarity compared with the other three plant communities. In the primary forest, light-demanding woody species dominated in soil seed banks, while shade-tolerant species dominated in the overstory and the forest floor. In the primary forest, seedlings of dominant tree species were rare in the understory, and no seeds of the dominant species were found in the soil. Results indicated that the early stages of vegetation recovery should take into account the possibility of recovering soil seed bank processes. However, colonization and establishment of tree seedlings will be difficult once a primary forest is destroyed.																	0912-3814	1440-1703				NOV	2010	25	6					1171	1182		10.1007/s11284-010-0742-y							WOS:000284422200013						
J	Tachiki, Y; Iwasa, Y				Tachiki, Yuuya; Iwasa, Yoh			Both seedling banks and specialist seed predators promote the evolution of synchronized and intermittent reproduction (masting) in trees	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Conditions leading to the evolution of masting (intermittent and synchronized reproduction of trees) are examined. According to the dynamics of the resource reserve of individuals, reproductive investment is the proportion of investment in flowers with coefficient k. If k evolves to sufficiently large values, trees show a large between-year fluctuation in the seed crop even in a constant environment (masting). 2. Our assumptions are: the forest consists of many sites, each occupied by a single canopy tree. After a canopy tree falls, the vacant site (gap) becomes available for recruitment. 3. Masting never evolves if all vacant sites are filled by individuals from seeds produced in the same year, despite the fact that trees reproducing intermittently enjoy a higher pollination success than trees reproducing annually. 4. Masting can evolve if some seedlings survive for several years, forming a seedling bank on the forest floor, where seeds produced in different years compete for gap acquisition. In this case, the disadvantage of intermittent reproduction is compensated for by seedlings and the benefit of pollen limitation dominates. 5. We also study the effect of specialist seed predators. In the complete absence of seed bank or seeding bank, masting never evolves even in the presence of seed predators. If some seedlings survive for multiple years, seed predators can promote the evolution of masting. 6. Synthesis. Both seedling banks and specialist seed predators promote the evolution of masting. However, the presence of seed predators can work only when some seedlings can survive more than 1 year. The regeneration process of forests must be considered when the evolution of the reproduction of plants is discussed.

Twenty-four 30 x 30-m plots were fenced in 12 ha of pasture in 2006. Seeds were collected in ninety-six 1-m(-2) seed traps; recruits were censused in similar to 12,000 m(2) in which establishment was allowed. We tested effects of distance from forest, living trees, and stumps of trees cut during site preparation on seed rain in 2007 and effects of these and soil depth on recruits through June 2008. Seed fall and recruitment were not correlated with distance to forest 90-400 m away, nor to living shade trees outside the 160 x 485-m experimental grid. Recruitment differed for animal- and wind-dispersed species in a topographically complex landscape. Recruitment of wind-dispersed species was random with respect to soil depth or distance to recent stumps. Recruitment of animal-dispersed species was multimodal; partial correlations with number of stumps within 30 m of plots were significant with soil depth held constant (P < 0.025), as were correlations of recruitment with soil depth with number of stumps held constant (P < 0.01). Animal-dispersed recruits were often not conspecifics of adults that had been cut, indicating a legacy of attraction by fruiting trees of animals bearing seeds from distant sources. Ecological implications are that recruitment in pastures released from grazing reflects a mix of widely scattered wind-dispersed pioneers and, where animal-dispersed trees exist, multi-modal and decidedly non-random recruitment of pioneer and later successional animal-dispersed trees from seed banks.

Seed bank density and species richness decreased significantly with altitude increase in both April and July. The highest elevations showed highest seed bank depletion. Although species composition of the vegetation changed along the altitudinal gradient, seed bank composition was almost unvaried from April to July. This indicated that seed bank density has an obvious seasonal change but composition does not. We found a low degree of similarity between the species composition of vegetation and of the seed bank along the whole gradient, and this similarity decreased with altitude increase. These suggest that the role of the seed bank decreased gradually with altitude increase. The hypothesis that a species seed bank strategy is an inherited trait was not confirmed because for some species seed bank strategy changed with altitude. We found that persistent seed banks were the most frequent strategy at all three altitudes. Species with persistent seeds tended to have smaller seeds than those with transient seeds only in highest altitude, while the other two altitudes did not show difference. There was no trend in seed size distribution with altitudes and soil depths.

Ant-mediated expansion of an obligate seeder species during the first years after fire	PLANT BIOLOGY												Most obligate seeder species build up a soil seed bank that is associated with massive seed germination in the year immediately after a fire. These species are also shade-intolerant and disappear when vegetation cover closes, creating unsuitable conditions for seedling recruitment. The only way for these plants to expand their populations is when habitats suitable for seedling recruitment arise (i.e. in years immediately after a fire). However, short primary seed dispersal of obligate seeders does not allow these plants to colonise the suitable habitats, and these habitats can only be colonised by secondary seed dispersion. We hypothesised that Fumana ericoides, an obligate-seeding small shrub, not only establishes abundantly in the first year after fire, but also expands its local range in the following years due to secondary dispersal by ants while suitable habitats are still available. We tested this hypothesis using experimental studies and a simulation model of potential population expansion in a recently burned area. Results showed that F. ericoides not only established prolifically in the year immediately after fire, but was also able to recruit new individuals and expand its population in the years following the fire, despite a low germination rate and short primary seed dispersal. Ant-mediated seed dispersal and availability of suitable habitats were key factors in this phenomenon: ants redistributed seeds in suitable habitats while they were available, which accelerated the expansion of F. ericoides because new plants established far away from the core population.

J	Herranz, JM; Ferrandis, P; Martinez-Duro, E				Herranz, Jose M.; Ferrandis, Pablo; Martinez-Duro, Esmeralda			Seed germination ecology of the threatened endemic Iberian Delphinium fissum subsp. sordidum (Ranunculaceae)	PLANT ECOLOGY												Seeds of Delphinium fissum subsp. sordidum are physiologically dormant at maturity, with underdeveloped embryos; thus they have morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). The aims of this study were to determine the requirements for embryo growth, dormancy break and germination, to characterise the type of seed dormancy and to evaluate the effects of light, seed age, pollination mechanism, and inter-annual and inter-population variability on germinative ability. After 3 months of incubation at 5A degrees C (cold stratification) in darkness conditions, the mean embryo length increased from 5.6 to 2.07 mm, with 76% of seeds germinating. Conversely, embryos of seeds incubated during 3 months at 20/7 or 28/14A degrees C hardly grew and no germination was recorded. Since cold stratification was the only requirement for the loss of MPD, and both dry storage in laboratory conditions and warm stratification prior to cold stratification shortened the cold stratification period required for germination, it could be concluded that D. fissum subsp. sordidum seeds have intermediate complex MPD. Cold stratification and incubation in darkness conditions promoted higher germination percentages than those in light. In addition, germinative ability increased with seed age up to 8 months (reaching 96% at 5A degrees C in darkness), showed a pronounced inter-annual and inter-population variability, as well as a significant decrease in seeds coming from pollination by geitonogamy. High temperatures (25/10 or 28/14A degrees C) induced seeds to secondary dormancy, so seedling emergence in the greenhouse was restricted to February-March. The requirements for dormancy break and germination reflect an adaptation to trigger germination in late winter. This study is the first one to document a gradual increase in germination percentage with seed age for plant species with intermediate complex MPD.					ferrandis gotor, pablo/0000-0003-2134-0218												1385-0237	1573-5052				NOV	2010	211	1					89	106		10.1007/s11258-010-9775-0							WOS:000282695700009						
J	Hilt, S; Van de Weyer, K; Kohler, A; Chorus, I				Hilt, Sabine; Van de Weyer, Klaus; Koehler, Antje; Chorus, Ingrid			Submerged Macrophyte Responses to Reduced Phosphorus Concentrations in Two Peri-Urban Lakes	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Eutrophication of two urban temperate dimictic lakes in Berlin (Germany), smaller Schlachtensee (0.4 km2) and larger Lake Tegel (3 km2), caused total phosphorus (TP) concentrations up to 800 mu g/L and a complete loss of their diverse submerged vegetation in the 1960s due to poor light conditions. Phosphorus stripping of their inflow began in the 1980s and caused a pronounced decline of their epilimnetic TP concentrations, eventually leading to reduced phytoplankton biomass and turbidity. Despite increased light availability, recovery of abundance as well as species diversity of submerged macrophytes was delayed by more than a decade, especially in the smaller lake. Slow oxidization of sapropelic sediment unsuitable for macrophyte growth, periphyton shading, herbivory, and/or lack of a viable seed bank were potential hampering factors. The present submerged vegetation, however, may already support mechanisms positively influencing water transparency such as providing habitat to enhance the ratio of piscivorous to planktivorous fish. Characeae meadows, typical for both lakes during their former mesotrophic state, so far only reoccurred in smaller Schlachtensee. Neither species composition nor abundance reversed back to the macrophyte community present in the nineteenth century. Although TP concentrations may decline further and some rare species have been detected, reassembly of this plant community will most probably not occur because many submerged macrophyte species have become rare throughout northwest Europe.

J	Toth, LA				Toth, Louis A.			Unrealized Expectations for Restoration of a Floodplain Plant Community	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The ongoing restoration of the channelized Kissimmee River is expected to promote reestablishment of the prolonged, deep inundation regimes that sustained broadleaf marsh as the dominant wetland plant community on the historical floodplain. The success of the restoration was evaluated at locations on the remnant floodplain where broadleaf marsh had been replaced by a mesophytic shrub community, and on the lower portion of the reconstructed floodplain, which was recreated by backfilling of a flood control canal and degradation of associated spoil mounds. During the 8-year post-restoration period (2001-2008) mean annual hydroperiods and depths on the restored floodplain were not significantly different from pre-channelization hydrologic conditions at historical reference sites. Increased hydroperiods and depths eliminated the mesophytic shrub (primarily Myrica cerifera) and associated fern cover, and led to colonization of floating and mat-forming species, but did not result in the reestablishment of a broadleaf marsh community. Signature broadleaf marsh species, Sagittaria lancifolia and Pontederia cordata, were found in all remnant floodplain plots and colonized 8 of the 10 reconstructed floodplain plots, but had mean cover ranging from only 0.9 to 6.1%. Several factors may have contributed to unsuccessful reestablishment of broadleaf marsh, including unfavorable edaphic conditions, brief drawdown (low stage) periods for establishment of seedlings, flood induced mortality, and an invasion of the exotic shrub, Ludwigia peruviana, which had post-restoration mean cover of 17-19%. Study results indicate hydrologic restoration of floodplain plant communities can be influenced by more discrete aspects of the river flood pulse than average hydroperiods and depths.																	1061-2971					NOV	2010	18	6					810	819		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2010.00731.x							WOS:000283718000005						
J	Reckinger, C; Colling, G; Matthies, D				Reckinger, Claude; Colling, Guy; Matthies, Diethart			Restoring Populations of the Endangered Plant Scorzonera humilis: Influence of Site Conditions, Seed Source, and Plant Stage	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Changes in land-use have resulted in the decline of many formerly common plants of nutrient-poor grasslands in Europe. Recently, extensification schemes have been applied at sites in order to restore former habitat conditions. However, the establishment of rare and endangered plants is often severely limited by the lack of propagules both in the seed bank and in the surrounding landscape. For such species deliberate introductions may be necessary to overcome these limitations. In a 7-year study, we assessed the importance of gaps created by sod cutting, of plant stage, and of plant origin for the restoration of populations of Scorzonera humilis, a threatened long-lived plant of nutrient-poor, wet grasslands. The effect of gaps on seedling emergence and survival varied strongly among the 12 sites. Gaps increased survival at nutrient-rich, but reduced it at nutrient-poor sites. Remarkably, young plants grown for only 5 weeks in the laboratory and transplanted into the same sites had much higher survival than seedlings from seeds sown and there were no differences in survival between nutrient-rich and nutrient-poor sites. The field performance of the plants from the various populations of origin varied depending on the site into which they were transplanted, indicating genotype by environment interactions and genetic differentiation among populations, but there was no home-site advantage. While sowing only succeeded in producing adult plants in five sites, transplanting succeeded at 10 sites. Our results suggest that transplanting young plants could be a much more effective and faster way to establish new populations than sowing seeds.

It has been classified as 'Endangered' by the Extremadura Regional Catalogue and placed in the equivalent category (EN D) of the National Red List because only one population in the world is known. Conservation of A. gines-lopezii requires a greater understanding of its population size, seed ecology and germination conditions. The latter issues are particularly important when establishing a reintroduction programme. This species was observed in nine colonies on the same mountainside, the largest of which consists of 60 plants. In this study, we compare the ability of the seeds to germinate under various conditions. Unlike most other members of the Fabaceae, the seeds of A. gines-lopezii do not need physical or chemical pre-treatment in order to germinate; instead they require a photoperiod for optimal germination. This study will facilitate a more in-depth understanding of this rare and poorly known species.

(Bromeliaceae)	ACTA BOTANICA BRASILICA												(Seed germination ecophysiology of the wild pineapple, Ananas ananassoides (Baker) L.B.Sm. (Bromeliaceae)). In this study we investigated the effects of light, temperature, and storage on seed germination of the wild pineapple Ananas ananassoides, an understorey species found in cerrado woodlands. Seeds were germinated at temperatures of 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 degrees C and a 12-hr photoperiod and continuous darkness for 30-d. Seeds were photoblastic and the optimum temperatures for germination were 25 and 30 degrees C. Seeds stored for 12-mo at room temperature and at 4 degrees C were set to germinate at optimum conditions. Germinability of stored seeds did not differ from that of recently collected seeds, regardless of storage temperature, indicating their physiological potential for seed bank formation. Our results suggest that as in tropical rainforests, light may be an important factor controlling recruitment from seed banks for small-sized species from the cerrado woodlands.

What is the role of vegetative spread and seedling establishment of meadow plants in the neighbourhood of the transplanted turfs? Location: Bile Karpaty Mountains, SE Czech Republic. Methods: Twenty-five meadow blocks, 0.4m x 0.4m in size, were transplanted to fallow land (unfertile and dry) and species composition was monitored in the source area, in the transferred turfs and in their neighbourhood for 3 yr. Multivariate analyses were used to assess successional trends. Results: The transferred meadow blocks served as a source of diaspores for the seed-limited fallow land. Out of 80 transplanted species 17 species spread to adjacent plots within 3 yr. The frequency of plants expanding from the transferred turfs, either vegetatively or by seeds, was relatively low and from 2002 to 2004 a total of 22 species declined in the transferred turfs before expanding to the neighbourhood. Successional trends in species composition of the plots adjacent to the transferred blocks were strongly significant compared with the vegetation of the source area despite the short-term data used for the evaluation. The role of the seed bank in restoration was negligible. Conclusions: In infertile and dry environments, transplanted turfs may significantly speed up restoration, especially if natural sources of target plant seeds are not available in the neighbourhood. However, the restoration process is long-term and not all transferred plants can be expected to establish in the fallow land.

Seed banks of Phragmites australis-dominated brackish wetlands: Relationships to seed viability, inundation, and land cover	AQUATIC BOTANY												In tidal wetlands of the eastern United States, buried seeds of the non-native haplotype of Phragmites australis may be a source of propagules for re-establishment after eradication efforts but factors controlling the development and expression of seed banks in non-native Phragmites stands have not been examined. We sampled surface soil at four Chesapeake Bay brackish tidal wetlands dominated by the non-native (European) haplotype M of Phragmites and used the seedling emergence method to quantity species of seedlings emerging under flooded and non-flooded soil conditions. Within each subestuary, one site was dominated by Phragmites that produced viable seeds (high viability) and the other by Phragmites that did not (low viability). We also described standing vegetation in plots, measured soil salinity, analyzed soil characteristics, and described surrounding land cover. Based on number of emerging seedlings, we found that 284 and 698 Phragmites seeds m(-2) occurred at the two high-viability sites, which was significantly higher than seed densities at the low-viability sites (10 seeds m-2), and greater than densities reported elsewhere. We also found that emergence of Phragmites seedlings from soil samples was prevented by continuous flooding of 3.5 cm of standing water, suggesting that colonization of deep water areas is clue to vegetative clonal expansion from Phragmites in adjacent higher elevations. The density of Phragmites seeds was not related to soil salinity or abundance of other species in the seed bank or vegetation, but instead was positively related to greater wave energy disturbance (much longer fetch and more open water) and lower area of wetlands nearby. The seed bank was more species-rich (15-22 species observed) than standing vegetation (3-15 species) at all sites, meaning that the dominance of Phragmites in vegetation does not prevent the development of a diverse seed bank and implying that a species-rich community may establish rapidly following control efforts. Based on these results and our findings in related studies, we postulate that wave energy disturbance generates repeated opportunities for seedling recruitment by Phragmites, which creates stands of Phragmites with higher genotypic diversity. In turn, genetically diverse stands favor greater cross-pollination and production of viable seed. These findings suggest that, in North America, targeting control efforts on non-native Phragmites patches in areas of higher exposure to wave energy may be more effective in reducing source populations than efforts in more protected locations.

J	Godefroid, S; Vanderborght, T				Godefroid, Sandrine; Vanderborght, Thierry			Seed banking of endangered plants: are we conserving the right species to address climate change?	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The increasing awareness of the effects of climate change on plant distributions in situ has made the appropriate application of ex situ techniques more crucial. These ex situ conservation techniques need to be targeted to priority species identified at risk from climate change. The present paper assesses the sensitivity of plant species to climate change in Belgium and explores the current conservation status of those species potentially vulnerable to climate change. We then checked whether these species were included in ex situ collections. The whole Belgian flora has been assessed (a total of 1,396 native plant species). We evaluated whether each of these species occurs in a "climate change-vulnerable" habitat, having therefore a higher probability to be impacted by climate change. The assessment revealed that there are at least 415 native plant species (30% of the Belgian native flora) that appear to be vulnerable to climate change during the next decades. Results also showed that about one-third of the species currently included in the red list may have their situation made potentially worse due to climate change. In addition, depending on the region, between 45 and 67% of the species that are currently not threatened in Belgium are likely to become so due to climate change. It also appeared that only 32% of these climate change-vulnerable species are currently held ex situ. We conclude that there is a need to identify gaps in existing ex situ collections as an urgent priority and ensure that species potentially vulnerable to climate change are conserved ex situ.

It has been shown that the cryogenic treatment does not kill seeds. The viability of 10 species did not decrease (or even increased) after their cryogenic storage. We have not revealed any deviations in the development of plants germinated from seeds stored at an extremely low temperature (-196A degrees C).

Worldwide, there are only a few forests as pristine and isolated as the Sierra de La Laguna in the southernmost range of the arid Baja California, Mexico. Its outstanding trait as a model system is that anthropogenic stressors are notably absent, which facilitates the study of natural ecological processes of the forest because separating human-induced ecological changes from natural ones is not a simple matter. In this study, we sampled sites and defined vegetation units on the basis of dominance of the canopy by the main tree species. We identified three forest types: the pine and encino forests that occupy the higher areas and the roble forest at lower elevations. For each living tree in the sampling plots, we measured height, canopy coverage per tree, diameter at breast height, as well as the amount of deadwood, leaf litter, and abundance of young trees. A succesional competition occurs between Pinus and Quercus sensu lato; we conclude that the encino forest represents a climax condition, the pine type represents an early succesional stage, and the roble forest type is a simple climax community.																	0045-5067					OCT	2010	40	10					2059	2068		10.1139/X10-121							WOS:000282587800017

The composition of seed banks on kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) mounds in a Chihuahuan Desert grassland	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Disturbance is a major factor determining the plant community structure of ecological systems. In particular, small-scale disturbances from animals can increase heterogeneity and species diversity in plant communities. Kangaroo rat (Dipodomys spectabilis) mounds are small-scale disturbances that support unique plant communities compared to surrounding habitats. The seed bank, which is usually an overlooked part of plant communities, is an important trait of some plant species that allows for their persistence in unpredictable environments. To further understand how small-scale disturbances by kangaroo rats affect the plant community in Chihuahuan Desert grassland, we studied the composition of the seed bank for eight forb taxa on and off kangaroo rat mounds. Kangaroo rat mounds accumulated more seeds and supported different seed compositions than the adjacent grassland. Also, kangaroo rat mounds had different microhabitats than areas away from the mound. This suggests that kangaroo rat mounds facilitate some plant species by providing microhabitats that contain 'safe sites' for seeds to accumulate where adult plant populations can establish and colonize thus increasing plant diversity and altering plant structure in communities.

Seed mortality ranged from 55 to 80%, and fire caused significant losses of native and alien annual seeds. Schism us arabicus, Schismus barbatus, Bromus madritensis, Bromus tectorum, Erodium cicutarium and Plantago spp. made up >95% of the seed bank. Bromus spp. and Plantago spp. had proportionately greater mortality of seeds than did Schismus spp. and E. cicutarium. Schismus spp. can be lodged into soil cracks thus avoiding lethal temperatures. E. cicutarium has a self-drilling mechanism that places the seeds at greater depth in the soil. Greater seed mortality occurred beneath shrub canopies than interspaces for most species (Plantago, spp., Bromus spp., and E. cicutarium), but microsite had little effect on Schismus spp. Fire reduced the perennial Ambrosia dumosa densities under canopies. Fire reduced the mean number of species found in samples by about one species per plot and no species was extirpated on experimental plots. The relative abundances of common species did not change dramatically as a result of fire or microsite, however; seed densities varied by treatment and affected interpretations of species compositions.

Effects of fire on vegetation and small mammal communities in a Mojave Desert Joshua tree woodland	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Wildfire size and frequency are increasing in Mojave Desert Joshua tree woodlands principally due to anthropogenic factors. These habitats are generally considered to be fire intolerant and the effects from fire are a major concern for land managers. This study investigated trends of ecosystem response to fire by looking at a chronosequence of historic burns. Plots were chosen at 2, 9, 13, 15 19, and 65 years since burn in which to sample vegetation and rodent communities. Rodent diversity was lower in burned plots and increased over time. The abundance of rodents however, was not significantly different between the burned and unburned plots. Vegetation showed a directional change in species composition with time since fire. However, reestablished vegetation assemblages did not converge to the assumed pre-burn condition. It is probable that this difference relates to the slow rates of establishment of certain vegetation components that make up the pre-burn condition of the plots. There is a concern that invasion by exotic plant species, nitrogen deposition, and global climate change may initiate a fire cycle in this ecosystem that will arrest succession before the Joshua tree woodland is allowed to reestablish.

We set up two study plots and collected 25 and 26 soil samples (each 20 cm x 30 cm x 5 cm depth), respectively, in April 1999, before clearcutting. Using the seedling emergence method, we detected 500-839 buried viable seeds m(-2) in 42-44 species. Soil seed banks in both plots contained typical pioneer species but few late-successional species. After clearfelling the plantation in June 1999, we censused seedling establishment for 4 years and the composition of the vegetation for 6 years. More than half of the seedlings emerged in the second year, suggesting that the timing of clearcutting is possibly critical to seedling establishment. Nineteen plant species disappeared after clearcutting, 40 species were retained and 43 species newly emerged after clearcutting. Most of the newly emerged species were pioneer species which originated in the soil seed bank. Seven of the pioneer species, as typified by Rubus crataegifolius, showed clonal growth from the third year after clearcutting. Japanese serow browsed the seedlings of major pioneer species, possibly affecting the process of secondary succession. Late-successional species such as Abies firma declined in coverage or disappeared after clearcutting. Our results suggest that the soil seed bank makes a major contribution to vegetation recovery after clearcutting, but possibly not to restoration of the late-successional species.																	1341-6979					OCT	2010	15	5					316	327		10.1007/s10310-010-0187-8							WOS:000282050900005

(ii) How does time since the last clear-cut change seed bank composition during post-clear-cut succession? Methods One data set was compiled per succession type using the following selection criteria: (i) the data set included a successional series, (ii) plots were located in mesotrophic forest plant communities and (iii) vegetation data were available. The post-agricultural succession data set comprised 76 recent forest plots (eight studies); the post-clear-cut succession data set comprised 218 ancient forest plots (three studies). Each data set was analysed separately using either linear mixed models or generalized linear models, controlling for both environmental heterogeneity and variation between study locations. Results In the post-agricultural succession data set, land use and time significantly affected nearly all the studied seed bank characteristics. Seed banks on former arable land recovered poorly even after 150 year of restored forest cover, whereas moderate land use intensities (grasslands, heathlands) yielded more rapid seed bank recovery. Time was a significant determinant of all but two soil seed bank characteristics during post-clear-cut succession. Seed banks in managed ancient forest differed strongly in their characteristics compared to primary forest seed banks. Conclusions Forest seed banks bear the marks of former land use and/or forest management and continue to do so for at least 150 years. Nevertheless, time since the last major disturbance, being either former land use or clear-cutting, remains a significant determinant of the seed bank.

J	Godhe, A; Harnstrom, K				Godhe, Anna; Harnstrom, Karolina			Linking the planktonic and benthic habitat: genetic structure of the marine diatom Skeletonema marinoi	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												Dormant life stages are important strategies for many aquatic organisms. The formation of resting stages will provide a refuge from unfavourable conditions in the water column, and their successive accumulation in the benthos will constitute a genetic reservoir for future planktonic populations. We have determined the genetic structure of a common bloom-forming diatom, Skeletonema marinoi, in the sediment and the plankton during spring, summer and autumn two subsequent years (2007-2009) in Gullmar Fjord on the Swedish west coast. Eight polymorphic microsatellite loci were used to assess the level of genetic differentiation and the respective gene diversity of the two different habitats. We also determined the degree of genetic differentiation between the seed banks inside the fjord and the open sea. The results indicate that Gullmar Fjord has one dominant endogenous population of S. marinoi, which is genetically differentiated from the open sea population. The fjord population is encountered in the plankton and in the sediment. Shifts from the dominant population can happen, and in our study, two genetically differentiated plankton populations, displaying reduced genetic diversity, occurred in September 2007 and 2008. Based on our results, we suggest that sill fjords maintain local long-lived and well-adapted protist populations, which continuously shift between the planktonic and benthic habitats. Intermittently, short-lived and mainly asexually reproducing populations can replace the dominant population in the water column, without influencing the genetic structure of the benthic seed bank.																	0962-1083					OCT	2010	19	20					4478	4490		10.1111/j.1365-294X.2010.04841.x							WOS:000282635700011	20875064					
J	Tonosaki, K; Nishio, T				Tonosaki, K.; Nishio, Takeshi			Identification of species in tribe Brassiceae by dot-blot hybridization using species-specific ITS1 probes	PLANT CELL REPORTS												Simple, reliable methods for identification of species are required for management of many species and lines in a plant gene bank. Species-specific probes were designed from published sequences of the ITS1 region in rDNA of 16 species in Brassica and its related genera, and used as probes for dot-blot hybridization with plant genomic DNA. All the probes detected species-specific signals at dot-blots of genomic DNAs of the 16 species in Brassica, Diplotaxis, Eruca, and Raphanus. Signals of the Brassica digenomic species in the U's triangle, i.e., B. napus, B. juncea, and B. carinata, were detected by the probes of their parental monogenomic species, i.e., B. rapa, B. nigra, and B. oleracea. The probe for B. oleracea showed signals of B. balearica, B. cretica, B. incana, B. insularis, and B. macrocarpa, which have the C genome as B. oleracea. Eruca vesicaria DNA was detected by the probe for E. sativa, which has been classified as a subspecies of E. vescaria. DNA of leaf tissue extracted by an alkaline solution and seed DNA prepared by the NaI method can be used directly for dot-blotting. Misidentification of species was revealed in 20 accessions in the Tohoku University Brassica Seed Bank. These results indicate dot-blot hybridization to be a simple and efficient technique for identification of plant species in a gene bank.																	0721-7714	1432-203X				OCT	2010	29	10					1179	1186		10.1007/s00299-010-0904-y							WOS:000281793300011	20683723					
J	Ochoa-Hueso, R; Manrique, E				Ochoa-Hueso, Raul; Manrique, Esteban			Nitrogen fertilization and water supply affect germination and plant establishment of the soil seed bank present in a semi-arid Mediterranean scrubland	PLANT ECOLOGY												Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) inputs in terrestrial ecosystems are higher than those that occur naturally and have been related to global biodiversity loss and altered ecosystem functioning. However, its effects on Mediterranean-type ecosystems, where production is water-limited and N regulated, remain unclear. We conducted a green-house experiment where we evaluated the effects of four simulated scenarios of N pollution (0, 10, 20 and 50 kg N ha(-1) year(-1)) and two differential water supply regimes on the germination (experiment 1) and early plant establishment (experiment 2) of a seed bank from a semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystem of central Spain. Seed bank density was estimated as 62,374 +/- A 3,279 seeds m(-2). Approximately 99.5% of emerged seeds corresponded to only 14 species of a total of 52, the majority of which were the annual forb Sagina apetala. The responses for N treatments were species-specific, mainly positive or unimodal, with watering treatments having some interactive effects. N and water supply also affected total and specific productivity; the responses found for N treatments were mainly humpback-shaped and an increased water supply had additive effects on community establishment in terms of total plant biomass. This response was linked to forb responsiveness. Contrary to predictions, grass biomass did not change with N supply; however, grass to forb ratio was affected because of changes in the latter. Overall, these experiments suggest a critical load for plant biomass production and conclude that N and water availability and supply can modify germination and plant establishment. This should be taken into account when analysing the effects of global change on the dynamics of plant communities where annuals are dominant or vegetation must establish from seed following a natural or anthropogenic disturbance regime.

The abundance of viable resting stages was enumerated with the most probable number (MPN) technique. Overall, 25 diatom species (including varieties) belonging to 16 genera were detected. Viable resting stage cells were common, on the order of 10(3) to 10(6) cells/g dry mass. The abundant taxa included Skeletonema marina, S. dohrnii, Chaetoceros curoisetus and Thalassiosira spp., with Skeletonema accounting for 83.3% of the cell. The effects of temperature (10, 15, 20, 25 degrees C), salinity (20, 25, 30, 35 psu) and light intensity (0, 300, 4 000, 8 000 lux) on the germination of resting stages in sediment samples were also determined. The results showed that light intensity had a significant positive effect on the germination of diatom resting stage cells (p <0.01) and that diatoms could not germinate in darkness. Temperature and salinity had no noticeable effects on the germination. The present study suggests that there are abundant diatom resting cells in sediments of the East China Sea, which could serve as a "seed bank" in the phytoplankton population succession and contribute to the initiation of algal blooms.

However, few comparative studies on plant distribution have assessed these traits simultaneously. Pollinator richness and frequency of visits, autonomous self-pollination ability, reproductive output (i.e., reproductive traits), seed bank strategy and seedling density (i.e., regenerative traits) were compared between the narrowly distributed Ipomoea rubriflora O'Donnell (Convolvulaceae) and its widespread congener Ipomoea purpurea (L.) Roth. The narrowly distributed species showed higher ecological specialization to pollinators and lower autonomous self-pollination ability. Frequency of visits, natural seed/ovule ratio and fruit set, and total fruit production did not differ between species. However, the number of seeds produced per fruit was lower in the narrowly distributed species, translating into lower total seed production per plant. Indeed, I. rubriflora formed smaller transient and persistent seed banks and showed lower seedling density than the widespread I. purpurea. These reproductive and regenerative trait results suggest that the narrowly distributed species may have lower colonization and persistence ability than its widespread congener. They further suggest that the negative effects of lower fecundity in the narrowly distributed species might persist in time through the long-lasting effects of total seed production on seed bank size, reducing the species' ability to buffered environmental stochasticity. However, other regenerative traits, such as seed size, and processes such as pre- and post-dispersal seed predation, might modulate the effects of plant fecundity on plant colonization and persistence ability and thus range size.

Comparative longevity of Australian orchid (Orchidaceae) seeds under experimental and low temperature storage conditions	BOTANICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY												Seeds from ten terrestrial orchid species, nine from the south-west Australian biodiversity hotspot (Caladenia arenicola, Caladenia flava, Caladenia huegelii, Diuris laxiflora, Microtis media ssp. media, Pterostylis recurva, Pterostylis sanguinea, Thelymitra crinita and Thelymitra macrophylla) and one from south-east Australia (Diuris fragrantissima), were placed into experimental storage to assess their relative longevity and likely optimal conditions for long-term conservation seed banking. Seeds from all species were desiccation tolerant, germinating after drying at 23% relative humidity (C. arenicola, C. huegelii, P. sanguinea and T. macrophylla) or 5% relative humidity (C. flava, D. laxiflora, M. media ssp. media, P. recurva and T. crinita) at 23 degrees C. From automatedly determined moisture adsorption and desorption isotherms at 23 degrees C, these equate to tolerance of drying to 0.03-0.06 g water g-1 dry weight or 0.013-0.028 g water g-1 dry weight, respectively. Results of storage experiments at a range of moisture contents and temperatures suggest conventional seed bank storage at -18 degrees C after equilibration at c. 23% relative humidity (at 23 degrees C) may be suitable for most of the species, although there was higher germination of P. recurva seeds stored at -80 degrees C and of M. media ssp. media seeds equilibrated at 75% relative humidity. However, there was considerable variation in germination of seeds sampled after different storage periods, making it difficult to identify optimal storage conditions definitively. Results of comparative longevity storage experiments at 60% relative humidity and 40 degrees C suggest seeds from these orchid species are short-lived compared with non-orchid species, and with Australian species in particular.

It has been argued that tree planting restoration is ineffective, and natural re-vegetation is an alternative ecological solution for restoring abandoned cropland and controlling soil erosion. The aims of this study were to investigate the characteristics of soil seed banks and to assess the natural restoration potential of abandoned cropland in the hilly-gullied Loess Plateau. The soil seed bank was identified by the germination method with the soil samples, which were collected at four sampling times (April, August, and October 2005 and August 2006) from 12 plots abandoned 3-30 years prior to sampling. The seed bank densities of all of the samples in the 0-10 cm soil layer varied from 1,067 +/- A 225 to 14,967 +/- A 1,606 seeds m(-2). Fifty-one species (24 annual and 27 perennial species) belonging to 18 families were identified, and 39% of these species belonged to the families Compositae and Gramineae. The pioneer species Artemisia scoparia dominated the seed bank, with an average seed density of 3,722 seeds m(-2), and accounted for 74.4% of the seeds in the bank. The local dominant species (such as Lespedeza davurica, Artemisia gmelinii, Bothriochloa ischaemun and Stipa bungeana) of the later succession stages also existed at densities varying from 17 to 1, 383 seeds m(-2). The combination of soil seed bank characteristics, reproductive traits of the species, the specific landscape conditions indicates that the potential to restoring the abandoned croplands in the hilly-gullied Loess Plateau via natural re-vegetation could be substantial.																	0364-152X					SEP	2010	46	3					367	377		10.1007/s00267-010-9535-x							WOS:000281979100005	20694556

These levees restrict the inputs of freshwater, nutrients, and sediment that historically replenished these wetlands. Wetland loss is compounded by other factors such as storms, introduced herbivores, and saltwater intrusion. How do such simultaneous changes in fertility and disturbance regimes affect the vegetation of coastal wetlands? Will proposed restoration strategies, such as freshwater diversions and protection from herbivores, increase the productivity and accretion rates of coastal wetlands without sacrificing plant species diversity? During this 2-year study, we applied five disturbance treatments (control, fire, herbivory, single vegetation removal, and double vegetation removal) and four fertility treatments (control, sediment addition, fertilizer addition, and sediment + fertilizer addition), using a split-plot factorial design with herbivory exclosures as main plots and species richness and total aboveground biomass as dependent variables. We found that nutria, the principal vertebrate herbivore of the marsh, limited biomass production. Other disturbances decreased biomass, but only to a limited extent in the absence of herbivores. The sediment + fertilizer treatment, which simulated the additional nutrients and substrate material that a freshwater diversion might deliver, significantly increased biomass production. Fertilizer significantly increased the biomass only in the absence of herbivores. We had limited success in predicting species richness after 2 years. Only the most severe disturbance decreased species richness, whereas fertilizer addition seemed to have a minor effect (p = 0.08). Sediment and nutrient-rich waters from freshwater diversions will likely mitigate negative impacts of nutria grazing on biomass and have no effect on species richness. However, it should be noted that freshwater diversions will have the most impact if nutria populations are reduced.																	0749-0208					SEP	2010	26	5					901	911		10.2112/JCOASTRES-D-09-00037.1							WOS:000282358200012						
J	Cutway, HB; Ehrenfeld, JG				Cutway, Heather Bowman; Ehrenfeld, Joan G.			The influence of urban land use on seed dispersal and wetland invasibility	PLANT ECOLOGY												Urban habitats are generally considered highly invaded by exotic species due to the frequency and extent of disturbance caused by human activities and development. Our previous study had demonstrated that forested wetlands within residential areas are more extensively invaded than wetlands within industrial-commercial areas. In this study, we investigate whether the structure of the forest edge and seed dispersal can explain the differential in the invasion of wetlands surrounded by industrial and residential land use. Our results indicate that edges of industrially bordered wetlands are denser, with vegetation concentrated at the boundary of tree growth, whereas the edges of residentially bordered wetlands are more open and diffuse. This difference influences the number of seeds and species capable of dispersing into the wetland. Less dense edges resulted in a higher number of seeds entering residential wetlands; however, there were no differences in the numbers of exotic seeds or exotic species in the seed rain residential and industrial wetlands. Although seed dispersal could not directly explain differences in the current extent of invasion of these sites, seed dispersal did follow corridor pathways, including ditches and trails that breach the edges and extend through the wetlands. These disturbances act as corridors for seed dispersal into both types wetlands and may play a role in introducing new species to the interior of the wetland, an outcome supported by a higher number of exotic species in the seed banks of residential sites. Our results suggest that both the type of adjoining land use and the provision of access to people on trails in urban wetlands can affect the composition of these communities.																	1385-0237					SEP	2010	210	1					153	167		10.1007/s11258-010-9746-5							WOS:000280577900012

Raynal (Valerianaceae) is a critically endangered narrow endemic to Central-Eastern Sardinia (Italy), where it occurs in rocky habitats. In the present study, the germination ecology of this species was investigated and compared with the relatively widespread species Centranthus ruber (L.) DC. subsp. ruber. In particular, the effects of a range of constant temperatures (5-25 degrees C) and two alternating temperature regimes (25/10 and 30/15 degrees C) on seed germination were analyzed. For the two species, cardinal temperatures were determined as the reciprocal of time to 50% germination (t(50)). In addition, seed persistence in the soil was assessed by experimental seed burials. Seeds of both species were non-dormant; however, C. amazonum produced more empty seeds and germination was slower and reached lower final percentages than C. ruber. Moreover, seed and seedling mass of C. ruber were higher than for C. amazonum and the lack of a persistent soil seed bank detected for C. amazonum increases vulnerability to extinction for this species.

Fertilization prevented nutrient impoverishment and increased height and dominance of the broad-leaved grasses with which many species-rich grassland herbs could coexist. The additive effect of the mowing/fertilization treatments was strong enough to act as a driver of P. bistorta suppression and associated community change. The litter removal treatment, however, had little effect on plant composition. The experiment demonstrates that in nutrient-limited grasslands, increasing nutrient levels in addition to mowing to manage competition for light can be used to control dominants. This contrasts with restoration of systems where after abandonment increased nutrient levels lead to the establishment of tall dominants that suppress other species by competition for light.

In this article, we propose the concept of "colonization credit" (i.e., the number of species yet to colonize a patch, following landscape changes) as a framework to evaluate the success of colonization, in terms of species richness, in new/restored habitats, taking into account the spatial structure of landscapes. The method mirrors similar approaches used to estimate extinction debt in the context of habitat fragmentation, that is, comparisons, between old and new habitat patches, of the relationships among spatial patch metrics and patch species richness. We applied our method to the case of spontaneous colonization of newly created habitat patches suitable for wet heathland plant communities in South Belgium. Colonization credit was estimated for the total species richness, the specialist species richness, and the species richness of three emergent groups (EGs) of specialist species, delineated on the basis of dispersal traits. No significant colonization credit was identified either in patches created 25-55 years ago or in those created within the past 25 years, with the exception of species from our first EG (mostly anemochorous species with long-term persistent seed bank). However, the differential response of species in that first EG could not be explained through their characteristic life history traits. The results of this study are encouraging and suggest that deliberate, directed restoration activities could yield positive developments in a relatively short period of time.

J	Hall, SJ; Zedler, JB				Hall, Steven J.; Zedler, Joy B.			Constraints on Sedge Meadow Self-Restoration in Urban Wetlands	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												Invasive plants and urban run-off constrain efforts to restore sedge meadow wetlands. We asked if native graminoids can self-restore following the removal of Typha x glauca (hybrid cattail), and if not, what limits their recovery? After we harvested Typha and depleted its rhizome starch reserves, Carex spp. expanded vegetatively (approximately 1 m over 2 years) but not by recruiting seedlings. A seedling emergence experiment showed that seed banks were depleted where Typha had eliminated the sedge meadow over a decade ago (based on aerial photo analysis). Carex seedling emergence was 75-90% lower where Carex was absent than where it remained in the plant community, and at least 17 species that were abundant 30 years ago were absent from the seed bank and extant vegetation. By varying hydroperiod, we showed that prolonged flooding prevented emergence of Carex seedlings and that a fluctuating hydroperiod reduced emergence and ultimately killed all Carex seedlings. In contrast, Typha seedlings emerged and survived regardless of hydroperiod. Thus, slow vegetative expansion by Carex, depauperate seed banks, and altered hydroperiods all constrain self-restoration. To compensate for multiple constraints on self-restoration, we recommend a long-term management approach that capitalizes on flooding and the capacity of Carex spp. to regrow vegetatively. We suggest annually harvesting swaths of Typha at the edges of clones, before or during flood events, to allow gradual, vegetative self-restoration of Carex spp.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				SEP	2010	18	5					671	680		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00498.x							WOS:000281552500007						
J	Cuevas, YA; Zalba, SM				Cuevas, Yannina A.; Zalba, Sergio M.			Recovery of Native Grasslands after Removing Invasive Pines	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												The advance of exotic tree and shrub species is one of the main threats to conservation of the last relicts of natural grassland in South America; however, control actions in the region are still scarce and there are almost no evaluations of the recovery of natural ecosystems after removing invasive plants. Monitoring of the vegetation during the years after removal of invasive trees is critical in order to decide whether an active restoration strategy is necessary. The recovery of montane grassland four years after the control of a dense invasion of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis) is described in this study. Experimental clearing areas were followed during four years and compared to grassland controls. Variation was seen in the levels of recovery in function of the proximity of sectors of grassland that are free of invasive species and/or the density of invasive trees before control. Native species slowly replaced many exotic herbs that had appeared as pioneers, there was low recruitment of pine seedlings in spite of the quantity of seeds from trees that surrounded the clearings, and species richness and diversity were restored, including cover of the typical grasses in the controls. Recovery of grassland after felling was shown to be successful and does not seem to be seed limited if tree removal occurs early in the invasion process.																	1061-2971	1526-100X				SEP	2010	18	5					711	719		10.1111/j.1526-100X.2008.00506.x							WOS:000281552500011

A total of 1.131 seeds was collected in the sampling area of the five arrays, of which 18,4% they were viable and 81,6% probably impracticable for germination. The dispersion of the seeds suffered influence from the topography of the place of the matrices, of the physiological and genetic answers daily early-dispersion, as well as of the possible favorable aiming of the wind. The joint action of these factors serves as relevant facilitators on the seed bank training as so as the probability of establishment of new individuals both in the studied area and also in adjacent vegetation.

Fire promotes Teline monspessulana (Fabaceae) invasion by increasing its germination	REVISTA CHILENA DE HISTORIA NATURAL												Worldwide, it has been reported that invasive species and fire can interact positively changing landscape dynamics and ecosystem cycles. This work aims to study the effect of forest fires on the seed bank of Teline monspessulana (L.) K. Koch (French Broom) and its implications for the invasion of the species in the mediterranean area of south-central Chile. For this aim, soil seedbank samples were subjected to different treatments that simulate fire conditions through controlled burns. In addition, for seeds taken from mature plants the optimal range of temperatures at which germination occurs was determined. The results show that after a wildfire germination of T. monspessulana increases significantly. Heating of the seeds was the factor that triggers this increase in germination. Furthermore, it was determined that the seeds reach their maximum germination rate when preheated between 80 and 120 degrees C for 10 minutes. At 140 degrees C, 100 % of the seeds die. During a fire, optimal temperatures for germination are reached about 2 cm in depth within the soil or at the surface in areas where the accumulation of fuel (biomass) does not exceed 5 tons ha(-1). The small portion of the seed bank that manages to be stimulated is offset by the large seedbank that can exceed 8000 seeds m(-2). This study shows that the fire, a common phenomenon in mediterranean areas and increasingly frequent in central Chile, would be promoting the persistence of T. monspessulana in areas with high human disturbance.

Lutz			Rapid burial has differential effects on germination and emergence of small- and large-seeded herbaceous plant species	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												The dynamics of many plant populations essentially depend upon seed and seedling stages, and a persistent seed bank may give species an opportunity to disperse through time. Seed burial is a decisive prelude to persistence and may strongly influence seed-bank dynamics. The fate of buried seeds depends on species-specific traits, environmental conditions and possibly also burial mode. We tested seed germination, seedling emergence and growth of the co-occurring herbaceous flood-meadow species Arabis nemorensis, Galium wirtgenii, Inula salicina, Sanguisorba officinalis and Selinum carvifolia in response to the experimental manipulation of burial depth (0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12 cm) and substrate type (sand, clay). Increasing burial depth led to decreased germination, emergence and growth in all species studied, and seedling growth differed significantly between substrate types. The responses of species differed on an individual basis, but also showed a higher-ranking pattern based on seed size. Larger-seeded species were able to emerge from greater depths and experienced less depth-mediated growth inhibition than smaller-seeded species, which, in turn, had higher survival rates during burial and were less likely to experience fatal germination. Based on these results, we suggest that herbaceous flood-meadow species have developed two different seed-size based strategies for coping with the extreme recruitment conditions prevailing in flood meadows, the balance of which seems to be maintained by disturbance events.

J	Tsuyuzaki, S				Tsuyuzaki, Shiro			Seed survival for three decades under thick tephra	SEED SCIENCE RESEARCH												Seed longevity in situ is a prerequisite for understanding the life histories and community dynamics of species, although long-term longevity under thick tephra has not been documented because of a lack of opportunity and/or awareness. The seed bank for this study was estimated by both germination and flotation tests. Seeds of 17 species have survived with high density, having been buried under thick tephra for 30 years, since the 1977-1978 eruptions on Mount Usu, Hokkaido Island, northern Japan. The total seed density was > 1000/m(2). Rumex obtusifolius was the most common seed-bank species for 30 years, but decreased in density between 20 and 30 years. More seeds of Hypericum erectum occurred in deeper soil. The total seed density decreased gradually for 30 years, but H. erectum and Juncus effusus did not decline. Native seeds tended to be viable longer than exotic seeds. These results suggest that small, native seeds tend to survive longer with deep burial, while the more numerous weedy, exotic seeds located at the soil surface declined faster. The seed bank provides long-term monitoring of seed survival under natural conditions, and could be used to detect genetic changes.

Impact of Parthenium hysterophorus on grazing land communities in north-eastern Ethiopia	WEED BIOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												An investigation into the impact of Parthenium hysterophorus infestation was conducted in 2007 in the north-eastern grazing lands of Ethiopia. Data on the above-ground and seedbank species diversity were collected from five areas, each having sites with low, medium, or high levels of weed infestation. A total of 72 species was found in all areas. They were categorized into grass species (23), other species (48), or P. hysterophorus for ease of interpretation. A regression analysis showed a highly significant, but negative, relationship between the above-ground species diversity and evenness with P. hysterophorus abundance. The mean cover abundance for the three infestation levels was 33.4% for P. hysterophorus, 41.0% for the grass species, and 26.5% for the other species. The most dominant grass species under all infestation levels were Cynodon dactylon, Urochloa panicoides, and Chloris gayana, while Andropogon abyssinicus and Eragrostis spp. were dominant under the low and medium infestation levels, respectively, and Hyparrhenia hirta was dominant under the low infestation level. Among the other species, Solanum nigrum was the most dominant under the low infestation level and Datura stramonium and Xanthium spp. were the most dominant under the medium and high infestation levels, respectively. The above-ground dry biomass of P. hysterophorus increased between the low and high infestation levels, while that of the grass or other species reduced in the high, as compared to the low, infestation level. Although the grass species density decreased significantly with successive increases in the P. hysterophorus infestation level, no such trend could be seen for the other species. Within the soil seed bank, the viable seed density for the grass species, other species, and P. hysterophorus were 25.7, 5.8, and 68.5%, respectively. Similarly, the soil seed bank under the low-, medium-, and high-infestation sites was dominated by P. hysterophorus, which contributed 25.1, 65.4, and 87.4% of the viable seed bank, respectively. Although the overall similarity between the above-ground vegetation composition and the soil seed bank was low, it was similar at the low-infested site. Thus, the invasion by P. hysterophorus was found to critically endanger the biodiversity of the grazing lands, particularly for the different grass and forbs species in the area. These changes might adversely affect not only future agriculture, but also food security, unless appropriate practises are developed and implemented for P. hysterophorus management.																	1444-6162					SEP	2010	10	3					143	152		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2010.00378.x							WOS:000281903000001

J	Gruber, S; Buhler, A; Mohring, J; Claupein, W				Gruber, Sabine; Buehler, Alexander; Moehring, Jens; Claupein, Wilhelm			Sleepers in the soil-Vertical distribution by tillage and long-term survival of oilseed rape seeds compared with plastic pellets	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY												Conventional tillage systems with high soil disturbance are being steadily replaced by tillage systems with low or no soil disturbance. An approach using three methodological steps (greenhouse, deliberate seed burial and field) revealed the long-term vertical distribution and losses of a soil seed bank as effects of different tillage operations. Seeds (oilseed rape; Brassica napus L) and seed substitutes (plastic pellets) acted as models for a seed bank. (a) A pot experiment in the greenhouse showed that emergence rates were highest in soil depths of 1-5 cm. Germination and emergence was clearly reduced in depths of 0 and 7 cm, and emergence was completely inhibited at 12 cm. About 40-50% of seeds fell dormant in 0 and 12 cm depth, while almost no seeds fell dormant in 1-7 cm depth. (b) The high-dormancy variety Smart persisted to a high extent (60% of the initial seed number), but only 8% of seeds of the low-dormancy variety Express persisted over 4.5 years, after deliberate seed burial. Seed persistence was similar in all soil depths of 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, and 20-30 cm. (c) The field experiment lasted from 2004 to 2009 and had different tillage treatments of inversion and non-inversion tillage: stubble tillage immediately after harvest combined with primary tillage by mouldboard plough (SP), chisel plough (SC), or rototiller(SRTT); primary tillage without stubble tillage by mouldboard plough (P), chisel plough (C); or no tillage (NT). The seed bank from an artificial seed rain of 20,000 seeds m(-2) was significantly higher in all treatments with immediate stubble tillage, and clearly declined over time. However, seed bank depletion was slow once a seed bank had been established. The distribution of oilseed rape seeds and plastic pellets (7000 pellets m(-2) broadcast) tended to equalise over the soil layers of 0-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm over the course of five years. Since seed bank depletion was not attributable to a specific soil depth, shallow and low disturbance tillage did not generally result in a high seed persistence. More important than the depth was the timing of tillage. Though no-till systems provided conditions for seeds to fall dormant at the soil surface to a small extent, the effect lasted only for a limited time. Seed substitutes can be well used in methodological approaches to picture movement of seeds in the soil in order to optimize tillage strategies in agricultural practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we conceptualised the spatial structure of shrub-grass patches as consisting of two components a grass crown of ill-defined outer borders (the 'grass component') encircling a shrub clump (the 'shrub component') We fitted exponential functions to autocorrelograms of spatially explicit shrub-grass cover data surveyed at different locations of the Patagonian Monte (Argentina) differing in livestock grazing pressure After that, we derived two metrics from the function parameters that quantitatively estimate the size of both the shrub and the grass components of shrub-grass patches The patterns of variation of these metrics are consistent with field measurements and observations previously reported for the studied areas, indicating that they are sensitive indicators of the state of development of the shrub-grass mosaic under different grazing pressures. These results suggest that its applicability to similar semi-arid shrublands deserves further attention.

A functional assessment of the response of grassland vegetation to reduced grazing and abandonment	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question Predicting the impact of land-use change on vegetation is vital to understanding how biodiversity and ecosystem function may respond. Is it correct to assume that abandonment is an extreme form of grazing reduction? Location Borders and central Scotland. Methods The analysis used data sets from two identical experiments where the impacts of two unfertilized, extensively grazed treatments and one unfertilized abandoned treatment were compared against the species dynamics of a pasture subject to normal, productive grazing management over a 16-year period. Initial multivariate analysis using Principal Response Curves was used to assess if particular traits were associated with either extensive or abandoned treatments, and was checked using univariate tests of individual traits. RLQ analysis followed by clustering into response groups was used to assess if species behaved in a similar manner between sites. Results For many traits/attributes the shift in value or proportion was approximately linear across the extensification treatments as grazing was removed. However, certain traits showed step changes and quadratic responses. Leaf dry matter content, an important effect trait, was in the latter group. Most traits/attributes and species behaved similarly at the two sites. However, traits such as regenerative strategy, seed length, longevity and mass and seed bank type behaved differently, indicating that they are not predictable response traits. Conclusion The results indicate that responses to grazing removal during extensification are largely straightforward and largely independent of species pool. However, there are discrepancies that suggest that simple analyses of the impacts of land-use changes such as grazing reduction may hide more complex responses.

Desiccation cracks act as natural seed traps in flood-meadow systems	PLANT AND SOIL												Desiccation cracks are a natural phenomenon of clay-rich soils that form via soil shrinkage during dry conditions. Our aim was to test the seed trapping potential of such cracks and assess its impact on seed bank formation in a flood-meadow ecosystem. We documented crack patterns on permanent plots and analysed the soil seed content along and adjacent to cracks. Seed translocation via cracks was tested with a mark-recapture experiment, and post-entrapment seed fate was tested with a burial experiment. Most cracks re-opened in the same positions in consecutive dry periods. Along cracks, most seeds were found in 10-20 cm depth, whereas adjacent to cracks most seeds were found in 0-5 cm depth. The majority of seeds found in shallow depths adjacent to cracks belonged to species that were also present in the above-ground vegetation, whereas this rate was always under 50% along desiccation cracks. The mark-recapture experiment gave evidence for vertical seed translocation through desiccation cracks. Post-entrapment seed fate differed between species and burial depth, with a trend towards increasing survival with increasing depth. We conclude that desiccation cracks act as natural seed traps, foster seed bank formation and thus influence plant community dynamics in flood meadow systems.

(Leguminosae), an exotic tall tree species in Japan: Impacts of stand growth and apicultural utilization	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												This study examined the factors that influence the size of a soil seed bank in Robinia pseudoacacia stands. We proposed two hypotheses: the amount of buried seeds of R. pseudoacacia is proportional to stand biomass rather than stand age, and apicultural utilization influences the size of the soil seed bank. R. pseudoacacia generally produces seeds with various degrees of physical dormancy. In addition, this tree is short-lived, and fecundity declines after 30-40 years in relation to tree vigor. However, R. pseudoacacia is intensively used in apiculture as an important honey source, and supply of honeybees by beekeepers could influence seed crops. We investigated 25 plantations in Hokkaido (Central, Hidaka, and Oshima) and in Nagano, Japan, where many naturally regenerated R. pseudoacacia stands occur. We found great variation in the size of the soil seed bank among stands, ranging from 13,757 to 6.4 seeds m(-2) per plot. A generalized linear mixed model revealed that both basal area (BA(Rp)) and apicultural utilization best explained the size of the soil seed bank. Both the positive effect of BA(Rp) and small contribution of stand age to the model implied that the soil seed bank is transitory, and will not persist for very long time. The large contribution of apicultural utilization to the size of the soil seed bank implied pollinator limitation under natural conditions. R. pseudoacacia often has large flower crops, and native pollinators can not keep up with the demand for pollination. Thus, the supply of honeybees by beekeepers should improve the pollination success of R. pseudoacacia. From these results, we conclude that we must consider stand history with respect to apicultural utilization if the land is harvested or a stand declines. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AGRARFORSCHUNG SCHWEIZ												Ambrosia control: not only in agriculture! The reaction of Ambrosia artimisiifolia L. was studied in recent years using field and greenhouse trials in Geneva and in Changins and 2009 in ring tests in various European countries within a EUPHRESCO project. The results showed that ambrosia reacts on a non-lethal control with re-sprouting and is able to produce - even in reduced quantities - pollen and viable seeds. The choice of control methods depends on the status of the invasion and on the type of the site. The main strategy of all methods must aim preventing the formation of viable seeds and must contain a sequential observation of the treated site. This paper discusses experience on control methods within and outside of agriculture in Switzerland.																	1663-7852					JUL-AUG	2010	1	7-8					260	265									WOS:000280751900002

A Comparison of Vegetation and Seed Bank Community Structure in a Sand Prairie in Illinois, USA	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Knowledge of both the vegetation and soil seed bank of a community is necessary to understand species storage and regeneration potential. Species composition and abundance were assessed in Thomson-Fulton Sand Prairie in northwestern Illinois, U.S.A. Species richness, evenness and floristic quality were greater for the vegetation than the seed bank. Jaccard's index of similarity was 36. In total, 43% of vegetation species were represented in the seed bank and 67% of seed bank species occurred in the vegetation. Native perennial grass and forb species dominated species richness and % cover of the vegetation. In the seed bank, native species also exceeded introduced species, hut annual species exceeded perennial species in species richness at the plot level. The relatively low correspondence between above-and below-ground community structure indicates that, in this grassland, seed banks function as storage for only a sub-set of species and many species in the vegetation must rely on sources other than the seed bank for regeneration.																	0003-0031					JUL	2010	164	1					136	150		10.1674/0003-0031-164.1.136							WOS:000279415500013						
J	Huebner, CD				Huebner, Cynthia D.			Spread of an invasive grass in closed-canopy deciduous forests across local and regional environmental gradients	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Spread of Microstegium vimineum, an invasive exotic grass, in closed-canopy forests of West Virginia, U.S. was evaluated across a local (roadside to forest interior) and regional (across two geographic provinces) environmental gradient. Seed dispersal distances from roadside populations into forest interiors based on seed rain and soil seed bank data were determined. Colonization and extinction of M. vimineum patches were followed over three years (2005-2007), and spread rate was estimated using a reaction-diffusion model. Direct seed dispersal from the roadside populations occurred primarily adjacent to the maternal plants, indicating that the disjunct M. vimineum patches within the forest interiors occurred via secondary seed dispersal over longer distances. Patches of M. vimineum were found as far as 45 m into the forest interior, but M. vimineum seed in the seed bank were only found within 10 m of the roadside population. Colonization rates of the forest interiors were significantly higher for the more mesic sites than the more xeric sites. The same trend was noted for the spread rate. Radial spread rates ranged between 0.16 and 0.50 m year(-1) and forest interiors were estimated to become saturated with M. vimineum in anywhere between 10 (more mesic sites) and 59 (more xeric sites) years. These results support the possibility of accelerating spread rates in forest interiors caused by more long-distance dispersal events, but slowed by a reduction in M. vimineum fitness in shaded or relatively dry environments.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				JUL	2010	12	7					2081	2089		10.1007/s10530-009-9610-5							WOS:000278897800016

Relative Importance of Seed-Bank and Post-Disturbance Seed Dispersal on Early Gap Regeneration in a Colombian Amazon Forest	BIOTROPICA												Early forest gap regeneration may be generated by postdisturbance seed rain and by seed, seedling or bud banks (i.e., resprouting). The relative importance of each process may depend on several factors (e.g., fruit/seed production, abundance and behavior of seed dispersers, gap characteristics, etc.). We experimentally compared the importance of seed-bank and seed-rain affecting early recruitment of seedlings in an Amazonian forest (Zafire Biological Station, Colombia), using soil transplants from forests to gaps and seed rain enclosures. We found that, during the 8-mo study, the seed-bank contributed with a larger number of individuals and species than seed-rain. The low seedling recruitment rates may be associated with reduced populations of animal seed-dispersers due to hunting and/or low levels of forest fruit production.																	0006-3606					JUL	2010	42	4					488	492		10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00605.x							WOS:000279438900013

Diversity of weedy red rice (Oryza sativa L.) in Arkansas, USA in relation to weed management	CROP PROTECTION												Weedy rice, specifically red rice (Oryza sativa L), is a major weed in rice which causes up to 80% yield loss and reduction of grain quality. Red rice accessions from Arkansas, U.S.A., were characterized to classify red rice accessions into certain phenotypic groups relevant to weedy rice management. The red rice accessions were 70% strawhull, 22% blackhull, 7% brownhull and <1% goldhull. Generally, blackhull red rice was the tallest (139 cm) and strawhull the shortest (133 cm) among all accessions. Blackhull red rice had more tillers (102/plant), smaller flag leaves (13 cm wide, 34 cm long), and flowered later (1225 heat units) than strawhull red rice which had 85 tillers/plant, 15 cm-wide and 34 cm-long flag leaves, and flowered after accumulating 1195 heat units. Morphological differences between accessions within each hull type were highly significant, showing great diversity within a hull color group as indicated by large ranges in traits. For example, blackhulls were 75-190 cm tall with 18-69 cm long flag leaves, 21-188 tillers and produced 40-949 g seed. Strawhulls were 46-189 cm tall with 18-66 cm flag leaf length, 16-172 tillers and produced 100-608 g seed. Some traits, such as seed production, differed widely between accessions within each hull color group such that the average seed production/accession for blackhull did not differ from that of strawhull weedy rice (196 vs. 192 g/plant). The onset of flowering among all accessions ranged from 56 to 126 d after planting. Red rice accessions formed six phenotypic clusters generally segregated by plant size or flowering time. Each morphotype would have different competitive abilities: thus, weedy rice management could be geared toward plant types. Highly competitive plant types would require intensive control measures to minimize yield losses and reduce the soil seed bank. Flowering dates impact stewardship strategies for herbicide-resistant or any genetically modified rice.

Hence, the study of its post-fire regeneration can support valuable new insights about functional adaptations to fire. Here, we analyse the first-year seedling establishment after fire in a P. canariensis forest on the northern slope of Tenerife, Canary Islands. The effects of fire severity and other explanatory variables on the seedling density recorded 9 months after fire were examined. We detected a clear unimodal relationship between seedling density and fire severity, with maximum regeneration associated with intermediate fire severity and no regeneration associated with very high crown damage. The results suggested that high severity fires may have caused the partial destruction of the aerial seed bank and/or the creation of unfavourable seedbed conditions for germination and seedling emergence. The density of large pine trees, reflecting seed availability, was the second most important factor explaining the distribution of seedlings. Cover of scorched needle litter on the ground correlated strongly and positively with pine seedling density and negatively with fire severity. The complete lack of regeneration at sites most strongly affected by fire does not represent a major threat for the stand recovery of the Canarian pine, due to the very high tree resistance to fire and the tremendous capacity of the Canarian pine to resprout after fire. The observed very high seedling densities at sites with intermediate fire impacts can probably be related to both the complete liberation of the seed bank (including seeds stored in serotinous cones) and favourable micro-environmental conditions for seed germination and seedling establishment.

The role of seedlings and seed bank viability in the recovery of Chesapeake Bay, USA, Zostera marina populations following a large-scale decline	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The objective of this study was to quantify the spatial and temporal recolonization characteristics of Zostera marina beds in the lower Chesapeake Bay following large scale declines in the late summer of 2005. Transects were established and monitored monthly for changes in eelgrass abundance at three sites (two downriver, one upriver) in the York River from April-October 2006 and 2007. Measurements included percent bottom cover, above ground biomass, shoot density, shoot origin (seedling or vegetative), seed bank abundance and seed viability. During 2006, the eelgrass beds at all sites recovered with seedlings providing the largest proportion of the total shoot abundance. This trend shifted in 2007 and surviving vegetative shoots were the dominant component of shoot standing crop. A second consecutive decline related to low light conditions occurred during the summer of 2006 in the upriver site and recovery there was minimal in 2007. These results highlight that after a single die off event, seed germination with subsequent seedling growth is the principal method for revegetation in lower Chesapeake Bay Z. marina beds. However, no viable seeds remain in the seed bank during this first year of recovery and shoots produced by the seedling growth do not flower and produce seeds until their second year of growth. Therefore the seed-bank density is low and is not immediately replenished. This suggests that the resiliency of perennial Chesapeake Bay Z. marina populations to repeated disturbances is restricted and repeated annual stress may result in much longer term bed loss.

Data from downcore pollen analysis (including pollen and spores from both aquatic vegetation, and terrestrial herbaceous, arboreal and shrub vegetation), modern vegetation monitoring and existing climate scenarios have been combined to provide a picture of the ecological changes in the pond over the last 13,600 years. Downcore pollen analysis throughout the last 13,600 years indicated the presence of species typical of Mediterranean Temporary Pond (MTP) habitats and suggested relatively drier conditions towards the present. The low number of non-native, cultivated species (such as herbaceous Trifolium and Plantago species) observed over this period suggested relatively low impact from crop agriculture, despite the increasing grazing pressure in the area. In the absence of independent proxies, we cannot reliably distinguish between natural and human-induced changes. The presence of aquatic Isoetes in the palaeo-record indicates the existence of an ephemeral pond in the area as early as the beginning of the Holocene suggesting resilience of the ecosystem over time. However, the degraded state of pollen in depths over 55 cm (i.e. 3600 year BP) increases the uncertainty of the interpretation. Currently, the pond holds 76 plant species belonging to 25 families. Therophytes and chamaephytes were the most frequent, suggesting a typical ephemeral habitat life form spectrum. Species richness was found to increase during spring surveys whereas the highest turnover was observed between summer surveys of consecutive years. Cluster analysis demonstrated a distinct zonation in four vegetation belts from the periphery to the centre of the pond which is typical of these environments. Modelling, based on two IPPC scenarios (A2 and B2), predicted relatively low climate change impacts on the pond's hydroperiod for the next 100 years (i.e. a decrease of 16 and 24 days, respectively). This reduction in the hydroperiod of the pond will have an effect on the physiognomy and spatial extent of vegetation, particularly for the transitional belts between the core and its outer area, while it will exert more pressure on the pond as a water resource for sheep in the region. However, cumulative effects and complex interactions of climate-driven environmental changes and other anthropogenic disturbances might act synergistically to accelerate impacts in the future.

Control Techniques and Management Strategies for the Problematic Navua sedge (Cyperus aromaticus)	INVASIVE PLANT SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT												Navua sedge, a member of the Cyperaceae family, is an aggressive weed of pastures in Fiji, Sri Lanka, the Malay Peninsula, Vanuatu, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, and Tahiti and is now a weed of pastures and roadsides in north Queensland, Australia. Primarily restricted to areas with an annual rainfall exceeding 2,500 mm (98.4 in), Navua sedge is capable of forming dense stands, smothering many tropical pasture species. Seventeen herbicides were field tested at three sites in north Queensland, with glyphosate, halosulfuron, hexazinone, imazapic, imazapyr, or MSMA as the most effective for Navua sedge control. Environmental problems, such as persistence in soil, lack of selectivity, and movement off-site, may occur using some herbicides at the predicted 90% lethal concentration (LC(90)) control level rates. A seasonality trial using halosulfuron (97.5 g ai ha(-1) [1.4 oz ac(-1)]) gave better Navua sedge control (84%) by spraying in March to September than by spraying at other times (50%). In a frequency trial, sequential glyphosate applications (2,160 g ae ha(-1)) every 2 mo was more effective for continued Navua sedge control (67%) than a single application of glyphosate (36%), although loss of ground cover would occur. In a management trial, single applications of glyphosate (2,160 to 3,570 g ae ha-1) using either a rope wick, ground foliar spraying, or a rotary rope wick gave 59 to 73% control, whereas other treatments (rotary hoe, 3%; slashing, - 13%; crushing, -30%) were less effective. In a second management trial, four monthly rotary wick applications were much more effective (98%) than four monthly crushing applications (42%). An effective management plan must include the application of regular herbicide treatments to eliminate Navua sedge seed being added to the soil seed bank. Treatments that result in seed burial, for example, discing, are likely to prolong seed persistence and should be avoided. The sprouting activity of vegetative propagules and root fragmentation also needs to be considered when selecting control options.

Many resources have been dedicated to the control of established beach vitex stands. Successful eradication will require knowledge of this plant's ability to reestablish from seed after control efforts. To understand seed-based regenerative potential, studies were conducted to characterize the fruits and seeds, document the existence and size of seed banks, determine stratification requirements for germination, and ascertain seed dormancy mechanisms. Studies of fruit lots from three consecutive years (2003 to 2005) found that the average fruit contained 1.39 seeds, and more than 76% of fruits contained at least one viable seed. A positive correlation existed between seed number and both fruit mass and fruit diameter. A substantial soil seed bank was discovered that contained viable seeds 4 yr after vegetation removal. Stratification was required for seed germination. All stratification treatments induced germination, with highest rates realized when stratification was performed at 10 C for 8 or 12 wk. Germination rates were modestly increased (from 0 to 17%) through mild scarification in the absence of stratification. Results indicate that beach vitex has physical (fruit coat) and physiological (seed) dormancy mechanisms that are capable of delaying germination for multiple seasons, allowing development of a soil seed bank. Beach vitex can reestablish from seed after vegetation removal.

A method to control existing R. pseudoacacia populations is urgently needed. In addition to plants above the ground, seed banks should be targets for the management of R. pseudoacacia. We targeted an old plantation of R. pseudoacacia and its surroundings in a headwater basin to determine the spatial characteristics of the distribution. We established 49 square plots in which the number of buried seeds and seeds dispersed by wind, and several other related environmental factors were surveyed. The relationship between the spatial extent of seeds dispersed by wind and the distribution of the seed bank was analyzed. Environmental factors that potentially influenced the density of buried seeds were also analyzed. We found that barochory and anemochory were the main factors that contributed to R. pseudoacacia forming seed banks. The greatest factor controlling the density of buried seeds was slope angle; thus, transfer of seeds by rolling is important for the formation of seed banks in headwater basins. From these results, some guidelines for the management of seed banks in headwater basin are presented. First, unnecessary soil disturbance within about a 100-m buffer area around seeding trees should be avoided. Second, plantation soil from gentle slopes should not be applied for revegetation of other locations. In situations where R. pseudoacacia populations are planted on steep slopes near streams, there is a chance that seeds will be carried away and form seed banks at lower or downstream sites.

This strategy would be favoured if plants accumulate a sufficiently large and genetically diverse seed bank during interfire intervals. We use a 16-year demographic study and surveys of microsatellite variation to quantify and explain the rate of accumulation of genetic diversity within the canopy seed bank of the shrub Banksia spinulosa. Flowering and fruit set were highly variable. An initial sample in 1991 of 354 reproductively mature plants generated 426 cones over 16 years, of which only 55 cones from 40 maternal plants persisted until 2005. By genotyping seed from these 55 cones we demonstrated that genetic diversity accumulated rapidly within the seed bank. Resampling revealed that diversity was determined by the number, not the age, of cones. Cones were widely distributed among plants, outcrossing rates were high (mean t(m) = 1.00 +/- 0.04) and biparental inbreeding low. Adults displayed little evidence of isolation by distance and the genotypic diversity of seed cohorts was independent of the density of neighbouring potential sires. We therefore estimate that within at least 13 individual years the number of cones produced per year (14-63) would have contained 100% of the adult genetic diversity. We conclude that a highly outcrossed mating system and relatively widespread pollen dispersal ensure the rapid development of a genetically diverse and spatially and temporally homogeneous seed bank.

PLANT ECOLOGY												The drawdown zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region was assumed to be completely formed in 2009 and the water level would range from similar to 145 m in flood season (summer) to similar to 175 m during non-flood season (winter). The soil seed bank is an important propagule source for vegetation restoration. In order to evaluate the potential of the soil seed bank to revegetate the drawdown zone of this region, we examined the quantitative relationships between the germinable soil seed bank and the established vertical and horizontal vegetation patterns. A total of 45 soil samples at four sites was collected to examine seed bank density, species richness, and composition using the seedling-emergence method. Forty-five species (from 20 families) germinated from the soil seed bank, and the average seed density was 4578 m(-2). The seed bank was dominated by annual plants, suggesting reestablishment of some above-ground species was plausible. However, most established woody plants and perennials were absent from the seed bank indicating a low probability of reestablishment for non-annuals through the seed bank. Thus, due to low species compositional similarity to extant vegetation and the dominance of annual plants, the soil seed bank had a low potential to restore pre-dam vegetation in the drawdown zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir Region, but its potential as a propagule source should be considered regarding the management of the drawdown zone for vegetation cover.

Do seed harvesting ants threaten the viability of a critically endangered non-myrmecochorous perennial plant population? A complex interaction	POPULATION ECOLOGY												This study analyzes the fate of seeds removed by ants, as well as the seed supply, seedling survival, and the ability to form persistent seed banks in the soil, in a critically endangered population of the non-myrmecochorous perennial halophyte Helianthemum polygonoides, in order to determine the extent to which seed removal by ants represents a real bottleneck for recruitment and thus a threat for long-term population viability. Apparently, the impact of seed-harvester ants was dramatic: the primary seed shadow was reduced by up to 93% by the activity of Messor bouvieri and Aphaenogaster dulcineae. However, M. bouvieri lost 7% of fruits collected by dropping them on trunk trails, mostly under plant cover, the most propitious microenvironment for recruitment. In addition, some seeds were mistakenly rejected in refuse piles, although here recruitment was extremely low. A significant fraction of seeds (a parts per thousand 40%) remained viable in the soil for over 2 years. In addition, H. polygonoides had the ability to form short-term persistent seed banks, in spite of the intense ant seed removal. In general, seedling recruitment was very low, denoting the scarcity of safe sites in the habitat. Overall, the data corroborate that seed removal by ants, although highly intense, does not compromise the viability of perennial-plant populations, because seed supply and seed reserve in the soil are enough to exploit current and future safe sites. A population viability analysis demonstrated that other threats affecting the survival of reproductive H. polygonoides plants actually constitute the real risk for the conservation of this critically endangered species.

Seedling Interference and Niche Differentiation Between Crested Wheatgrass and Contrasting Native Great Basin Species	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Interference from crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum [L.] Gaertn.) seedlings is considered a major obstacle to native species establishment in rangeland ecosystems; however, estimates of interference at variable seedling densities have not been defined fully. We conducted greenhouse experiments using an addition-series design to characterize interference between crested wheatgrass and four key native species. Crested wheatgrass strongly interfered with the aboveground growth of Wyoming big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt. subsp. wyomingensis Beetle & Young), rubber rabbitbrush (Ericameria nauseosa [Pall. ex Pursh] G. L. Nesom & Baird subsp. consimilis [Greene] G. L. Nesom & Baird), and to a lesser extent with bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata [Pursh] A. Love). Alternatively, bottlebrush squirreltail (Elymus elymoides [Raf.] Swezey subsp. californicus [J. G. Sm.] Barkworth) and crested wheatgrass had similar effects on each other's growth, and interference ratios were near 1.0. Results indicate that the native grasses more readily establish in synchrony with crested wheatgrass than these native shrubs, but that once established, the native shrubs are more likely to coexist and persist with crested wheatgrass because of high niche differentiation (e.g., not limited by the same resource). Results also suggest that developing strategies to minimize interference from crested wheatgrass seedlings emerging from seed banks will enhance the establishment of native species seeded into crested wheatgrass-dominated communities.

J	Hulet, A; Roundy, BA; Jessop, B				Hulet, April; Roundy, Bruce A.; Jessop, Brad			Crested Wheatgrass Control and Native Plant Establishment in Utah	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Effective control methods need to be developed to reduce crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum [L.] Gaertner) monocultures and promote the establishment of native species. This research was designed to determine effective ways to reduce crested wheatgrass and establish native species while minimizing weed invasion. We mechanically (single- or double-pass disking) and chemically (1.1 L . ha(-1) or 3.2 L . ha(-1) glyphosate Roundup Original Max) treated two crested wheatgrass sites in northern Utah followed by seeding native species in 2005 and 2006. The study was conducted at each site as a randomized block split plot design with five blocks. Following wheatgrass-reduction treatments, plots were divided into 0.2-ha subplots that were either unseeded or seeded with native plant species using a Truax Rough Rider rangeland drill. Double-pass disking in 2005 best initially controlled wheatgrass and decreased cover from 14% to 6% at Lookout Pass and from 14% to 4% at Skull Valley in 2006. However, crested wheatgrass recovered to similar cover percentages as untreated plots 2-3 yr after wheatgrass-reduction treatments. At the Skull Valley site, cheatgrass cover decreased by 14% on herbicide-treated plots compared to an increase of 33% on mechanical-treated plots. Cheatgrass cover was also similar on undisturbed and treated plots 2 yr and 3 yr after wheatgrass-reduction treatments, indicating that wheatgrass recovery minimized any increases in weed dominance as a result of disturbance. Native grasses had high emergence after seeding, but lack of survival was associated with short periods of soil moisture availability in spring 2007. Effective wheatgrass control may require secondary treatments to reduce the seed bank and open stands to dominance by seeded native species. Manipulation of crested wheatgrass stands to restore native species carries the risk of weed invasion if secondary treatments effectively control the wheatgrass and native species have limited survival due to drought.																	1550-7424	1551-5028				JUL	2010	63	4					450	460		10.2111/REM-D-09-00067.1							WOS:000280315300007

Growth Regulator Herbicides Prevent Invasive Annual Grass Seed Production Under Field Conditions	RANGELAND ECOLOGY & MANAGEMENT												Growth regulator herbicides, such as 2,4-D, dicamba, picloram, and aminopyralid, are commonly used to control broadleaf weeds in rangelands, noncroplands, and cereal crops. If applied to cereals at late growth stages, while the grasses are developing reproductive parts, the herbicides often reduce cereal seed production. We are researching methods for using this injury response to control invasive annual grasses in rangelands by depleting their short-lived seed banks. In a previous greenhouse study, we found picloram and dicamba reduced seed production of the invasive annual grass Japanese brome (Bromus japonicus Thunb.) by nearly 100%. However, this promising greenhouse finding needs to be corroborated in the field before growth regulators can be confidently recommended for invasive annual grass control. This research note describes a study conducted in eastern Montana suggesting growth regulators may provide excellent control of invasive annual grasses. Specifically, we found typical use rates of aminopyralid and picloram reduced Japanese brome seed production by more than 95% (based on sample means) when applied at three different plant growth stages. This promising result contributes to the accumulating body of evidence suggesting growth regulators may control invasive annual grasses.																	1550-7424					JUL	2010	63	4					487	490		10.2111/REM-D-09-00141.1							WOS:000280315300011						
J	Mackenzie, DD; Naeth, MA				Mackenzie, Dean D.; Naeth, M. Anne			The Role of the Forest Soil Propagule Bank in Assisted Natural Recovery after Oil Sands Mining	RESTORATION ECOLOGY												This study was undertaken to determine if use of stratified organic layers of intact litter, fragmented litter, and humus on the forest floor (LFH) improves establishment of upland native boreal plant species during oil sands reclamation in Alberta, Canada. The abundance and composition of vascular plant species in the soil propagule bank were determined for LFH and peat materials before salvage from donor sites and 18 months after application on the receiver site. Applications of 10 and 20 cm were evaluated. Various soil properties were assessed to determine impacts of donor materials. In the growth chamber, LFH donor material had significantly more plant species emerge (37) from the propagule bank than did peat donor material (19). In the field, LFH treatments had significantly higher species richness (49, 47, 24, and 25 species for LFH 10 cm, LFH 20 cm, peat 10 cm, and peat 20 cm treatments, respectively), plant abundance, and soil nutrients than peat treatments. Application thickness of peat had little effect, but 20 cm of LFH was more beneficial for plant community establishment than 10 cm. LFH treatments had narrower C:N ratios and higher soluble potassium and available phosphorus than peat. Applying 10 versus 20 cm of donor material increased admixing of fine-textured subsoil, reducing organic carbon, nitrogen, and potassium; these effects were greater for LFH than peat treatments. Thus, addition of LFH aids in creating diverse ecosystems on reclaimed upland landscapes by providing a source of propagules for revegetating upland boreal forest communities and improving nutrient availability for plants.

Under this framework, weed community assembly is constrained by abiotic and biotic "filters" that act on species traits to determine community composition. We used an assembly approach to investigate the response of weed seed banks to 25 yr of management-related Altering in three different row-crop management systems in southeastern Pennsylvania: organic manure-based, organic legume-based, and conventional. Weed seed banks were sampled in April of 2005 and 2006 and quantified by direct germination in a greenhouse. We also assessed the Altering effects of weed management practices and relationships between assembled seed bank and emergent weed communities by allowing or excluding weed control practices within each management system and measuring emergent weed community response. Germinable weed seed bank densities and species richness in the Anal year of the study were over 40% and 15% higher, respectively, in the organic systems relative to the conventional system. Seed bank community structure in the organic systems was different from the conventional system, and the relationships between assembled seed banks and the emergent flora varied. Primary tillage, weed control, timing of planting, and fertility management appeared to be the main Alters that differentiated weed seed banks in the three systems. Weed life history, emergence periodicity, seed size, and responsiveness to soil fertility and hydrology appeared to be the most important functional traits determining how weed species responded to management-related filters. Our results suggest that management systems can exert strong Altering effects that can persist over relatively long (greater than one growing season) time scales. Legacy effects of community-level Altering might be more important than previously assumed, and should be incorporated into predictive models of weed community assembly.

J	Pfleeger, TG; Plocher, M; Bichel, P				Pfleeger, Thomas G.; Plocher, Milton; Bichel, Puja			Response of pioneer plant communities to elevated ozone exposure	AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Considerable research has documented the effects of ozone on crop plants, but little experimental work has examined the effects of ozone on natural vegetation. Our objective was to determine how a plant community responds over several generations to elevated ozone exposures. Seed bank soil collected from the Oregon State University Farm, containing a population of naturalized plants common to the Willamette Valley, was uniformly dispersed across the surface of nine modified open top chambers. Each chamber was randomly assigned one of three ozone treatments (0, 90 and 120 ppb episodic ozone). Sixty plant species from 22 families emerged in the chambers over the four year study. Seedling emergence was a highly sensitive period. High seedling mortality rates in the ozone treatments allowed more resistant individuals to persist. Communities not exposed to elevated ozone levels also had high rates of mortality probably due to density dependant mortality. No species were eliminated from the communities because of ozone. Plant species did not demonstrate ozone tolerance or susceptibility based on taxonomic relationships. Year-to-year environmental heterogeneity was a stronger influence on community composition than ozone exposures. At the community level, there was a trend of decreasing biomass with increasing ozone exposure. In the ozone treatments, premature senescence of taller species increased light availability to understory species, changing competitive interactions and altering community dynamics in the understory. The effects of ozone on individual species, both direct and indirect, in a community may be detrimental, insignificant, or positive. Predication of a species performance in a community will be difficult due to the many environmental and biological interactions occurring simultaneously or at alternative times during a specific species life cycle. Studies are necessary to decrease the uncertainty in attempting to assess the impact of ozone on both managed and natural ecosystems currently determined from extrapolating the effects on individuals. Currently, plant communities remain protected at an unknown level from ozone exposure.

Soil cores from adjoining semi-natural and conifer-containing stands in four lowland ancient woods in central England were removed to establish seed bank species richness. During a fourteen-month germination trial soil from two depths yielded 6554 seedlings from 81 species, ten of which showed a strong affinity for ancient woodland conditions. Juncus effusus accounted for 80% of emergent seeds whilst 23 other species, including Lysimachia nummularia and Potentilla sterilis, were represented by only one individual. Species richness is described by a model that explains 40% of observed variance (P < 0.00001). The model has three significant variables: species richness increases as soil pH rises, and decreases with both depth and increasing time since the most recent planting/disturbance event. No difference was found in the density of seeds from species common to paired semi-natural and conifer-containing stands that were separated only by a woodland ride, suggesting prior management and environmental conditions have a greater influence on seed banks than current stand type. Sorensen similarity index values revealed poor congruence between above-ground vegetation and species in the seed bank. Taking pH measurements in conifer stands identified as younger in terms of planting/disturbance may help locate areas where greater numbers of species (including woodland specialists) are located. Caution is required, however, as these seed banks may also contain non-target, competitive species that may swamp the regeneration of woodland specialists.

J	Gioria, M; Osborne, B				Gioria, Margherita; Osborne, Bruce			Similarities in the impact of three large invasive plant species on soil seed bank communities	BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS												Invasions by alien plant species may substantially alter soil seed bank communities. While decreases in seed bank species richness, diversity, and composition as a consequence of plant invasions have been reported, the characteristics of seed banks associated with different invasive species have not been compared in any detail. Here, we describe changes in the characteristics of soil seed banks invaded by three large herbaceous invasive plants, Fallopia japonica, Gunnera tinctoria, and Heracleum mantegazzianum. The study was carried out at the spatial scales of site and plot, to reduce variability in seed bank data. Information on seed bank persistence was inferred from seed depth (0-5, 5-10, and 10-15 cm) and from time of sampling (May and October). Despite differences in the reproductive strategy and geographic distribution of these invaders, as well as in the standing vegetation and habitat types examined, the seed banks of invaded areas were similar in composition and in the relative abundance of different species. Invaded seed banks were dominated by seeds of a few agricultural weed species and/or rushes, suggesting that common features of the invaders, including a large standing biomass, extensive litter production, and the formation of mono-species stands may result in comparable selection pressures that favors traits that are largely genera or species-specific. These findings have a direct relevance for the development of strategies aimed at restoring previously-invaded sites while also improving our understanding of the long-term implications of plant invasions.

Vegetation, habitat characteristics and disturbance history were surveyed in 32 invaded stands vs. 32 paired uninvaded stands, after a random stratification. Community specialization and functional diversity indices were compared and a RLQ analysis was run to link species traits to environmental variables. The herb layer of invaded stands exhibited significantly more specialist species and a lower trait diversity compared to uninvaded stands, with respect of species richness and vegetation cover. Light arrival to the forest floor and soil properties explained most of the variation in the RLQ analysis, but 20% of the variation strongly correlated with P. serotina dominance and associated disturbances. Traits characterizing shade-tolerant, short-living ruderals and shade-avoiders (vernal geophytes) were significantly associated to invaded stands, while those associated to light-demanding graminoids characterized uninvaded stands. The establishment of functionally close species (seedlings and saplings of native woody species) tended to be lower in invaded stands. We concluded that the invader was becoming the new ecosystem engineer, first by inducing trait convergence and community specialization, thus promoting traits that enable species to capture resources in the new environment it was creating, and second by reducing the grain of local heterogeneities.																	1387-3547	1573-1464				JUN	2010	12	6					1891	1907		10.1007/s10530-009-9599-9							WOS:000277410800042

We compared its composition and abundance in two sites, one burned and one unburned. An important proportion of seeds died due to the high temperatures reached by fire. In addition, species richness and, diversity were also negatively affected. These variables showed statistical differences between sites and years. After one year, seed bank abundance and diversity reached higher values. Dominant species were perennial herbs in terms of species number, and in terms of seedling abundance the dominant life form was a tree. However, fire was not a determinant factor in terms of species composition. These results are important to explain the changes in vegetation after a fire, specially if we consider that this site is a natural preserve immersed in an urban area.																	0366-2128					JUN	2010	86						11	21									WOS:000279050900002

Ex Situ Conservation of Orchids in a Warming World	BOTANICAL REVIEW												Whilst there is overwhelming scientific evidence that dramatic changes in regional climates are likely to occur throughout the 21st century, the scientific community remains uncertain how the effects of global heating will combine with other environmental factors to affect wild orchid populations. It is, however, likely that many populations will be affected adversely and that in situ conservation techniques by themselves will not be sufficient to prevent the extinction of many species. A range of complimentary ex situ strategies are discussed. Amongst these orchid seed banking has been shown to be an invaluable tool for conserving the maximum amount of genetic diversity in the minimum space and has the potential to enable the conservation of valuable material for possible re-introduction and habitat restoration programmes in the future. The Darwin Initiative project, 'Orchid Seed Stores for Sustainable Use' (OSSSU), is currently establishing a global network of orchid seed banks focussing initially on countries with high orchid biodiversity in Asia and Latin America. Particular reference is made to ex situ conservation in China, together with the urgent need to gather more data to determine which habitats and species are most at risk of extinction in the wild in the immediate future.																	0006-8101	1874-9372				JUN	2010	76	2					193	203		10.1007/s12229-010-9048-6							WOS:000277604400005

Scale-dependent effects of pines on the herbaceous layer diversity in a semi-arid mediterranean ecosystem	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												In arid and semi-arid ecosystems, the presence of woody neighbours affects the existence of several herbaceous species by modifying critical aspects of the environment (e.g., soil humidity, nutrient content or light availability) beneath their canopies. Herbaceous species growing in the understory of Pinus pinaster may be distinct from those in open areas due to litter fall, light interceptions and changes in nutrient availability. We suggest that the overall effect of woody neighbours on herbaceous layer diversity may vary with the scale focus of analysis. To examine this hypothesis, we collected data on the abundance of herbaceous species in open pineland forests of the central Iberian Peninsula (Spain) using sample quadrats of 0.5m x 0.5m distributed beneath, at the edge, and outside at the canopy of pines in a landscape composed of dunes and plains. The results of CCA ordination revealed significant spatial segregation of herbaceous species reflecting the occurences of pines and dunes in the landscape. Nested ANOVA disclosed markedly lower species richness beneath the pines, particularly in the dune sites. Species richness partitioning showed higher pine-induced heterogeneity than expected from the sample-based randomized model, leading to significantly increased species richness at the patch level. Hence, the outcome of pine-incuced effects on the herbaceous plant diversity is scale-dependent, negative if we focus on seperate communism but positive if the scale focus is extended to whole patches comprising the sum of communities beneath, at the edge, and outside pine tree canopies. These results emphasize the necessity of using various scale perspectives to clarify the different ways in which pines and other woody nurse species affect structure of herbaceous communities in semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystems.

CONSERVATION GENETICS												The aim of this study was to estimate genetic diversity and assess its importance for plant fitness in a species belonging to the most endangered species in Europe, Dracocephalum austriacum L., and to select the most valuable populations for conservation of genetic diversity within the species in the studied regions. We analyzed allozyme variation of 12 populations in three distinct regions (Czech Karst, Moravia and Slovak Karst) in Central Europe. The results showed high genetic diversity within populations (80.14%) and relatively low differentiation among populations within regions (9.42%) and between regions (10.45%). Seed production was significantly higher in larger, genetically more diverse and less inbred populations. The results suggest that genetic diversity has important effect on seed production in this species and thus can be expected to have strong direct consequences for plant fitness and vitality of the whole populations. They also show large variation in genetic diversity between populations and indicate which populations should get a priority in attempts to conserve all the genetic diversity within the region.

Optimal management strategies to control local population growth or population spread may not be the same	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												The objective of most pest management programs is to "control'' the pest species. However, optimal control of local abundance and population growth may require different management strategies than optimal control of spatial spread. We use coupled demographic-dispersal models to address the relative importance of different management approaches to these two main control objectives for the invasive thistle Carduus nutans. The models are parameterized with data from thistle populations in the native (France) and invaded ranges (Australia and New Zealand). We assess a wide range of commonly used management strategies for their absolute and relative impacts on population growth and spread in both invaded-range scenarios. The projected population growth rate in New Zealand is more than twice that in Australia, while the spread rate is more than four times the Australian value. In general, spread and growth are both most strongly affected by the same life cycle transitions; however, in a few cases certain vital rates disproportionately affect either spread or growth. The transition that represents the contribution of large rosettes in one year to the number of large rosettes in the following year (the large rosette-large rosette transition) in Australia is dominated by reproduction (rather than survival) and hence is relatively more important to spread than to population growth. In New Zealand, the small rosette-small rosette transition is also predominantly dispersal-related. However, establishment of small plants from the seed bank contributes more to population growth than spread, as no dispersal is involved. The fine-resolution vital-rate-based modeling approach allows us to identify potentially novel optimal management strategies: approaches that reduce microsite availability show promise for reducing both population growth and spread, while strategies that affect dispersal parameters will affect spread. Additionally, the relative ranking of some biocontrol agents shifts depending on whether control of population growth or population spread is the desired outcome and therefore could alter which of the agents are preferred for release in a new area. The possibility of differences in ranked agent effectiveness has been predicted theoretically, but never before demonstrated using field data.

Effect of drying, salinity and temperature on seed germination of the submersed wetland monocot, Vallisneria australis	FUNDAMENTAL AND APPLIED LIMNOLOGY												Periods of low water level ('drawdown') may kill mature submersed aquatic plants and their vegetative propagules. Re-establishment from a sediment-based seed bank may be limited by desiccation, high temperatures and increased salinity, environmental changes that may often accompany drawdown. Vallisneria australis (Hydrocharitaceae) is a common, submersed clonal wetland plant in southeastern Australia, which reportedly reproduces mainly by vegetative spread. Although vegetative growth in this species is inhibited by drying and salinity, it is not known how such conditions influence the germination of sediment-stored seed, and so whether re-colonisation from seeds can occur after drawdown. Hence, this study examined whether drying, high temperature or high salinity reduced the germination of V. australis seeds. Germination was slowed by drying, with significant germination still occurring 20-30 weeks after re-wetting. The final percentage germination of seeds that had been dried for 8, 16 or 32 weeks and then rewetted was approximately twice that of seeds that remained wet. Moreover, sediment-stored seeds germinated only after drying, suggesting that drawdown would promote germination of V. australis in the field. Final germination of wet-stored seeds was 44 % at 25 degrees C but only 7 % at 35 degrees C, indicating that germination may be inhibited over summer in southeastern Australian wetlands. Although percentage germination declined with increasing salinity, some seeds still germinated (similar to 10 %) at the highest salinity tested, 23 dS m(-1). Variability in the time V. australis seeds take to germinate may represent a mechanism that increases the opportunities for regeneration in an unpredictable environment. The demonstrated tolerance of seeds to drying and salinity suggests that, even in salinised wetlands, V. australis may be able to recolonise from the sediment-based seed bank following the loss of mature plants after a drawdown, provided viable seeds are present.																	1863-9135					JUN	2010	177	2					105	114		10.1127/1863-9135/2010/0177-0105							WOS:000283668300003

Water-level regulation and coastal wetland vegetation in the upper St. Lawrence River: inferences from historical aerial imagery, seed banks, and Typha dynamics	HYDROBIOLOGIA												We evaluated habitat changes of tributary (drowned river mouth) wetlands in the upper St. Lawrence River with analysis of pre-and post-regulation water levels and historical vegetation reconstruction from aerial photographs. In addition, the germination response of transplanted wetland soil was compared to understand responses to moist versus saturated hydrology. Typha stem density was sampled in reference sites under the influence of water-level regulation by the International Joint Commission (IJC) and compared to treatment sites where installed control structures held levels (< 0.7 m) higher. Major hydrologic changes due to regulation included a reduction of inter-annual variability with a reduction in peak levels and periodic lows, leading to a dampening of 30-40 year water-level cycles. Wetland photo interpretation indicated that flooded and mixed habitat categories were apparent at all sites for pre-regulation in 1948, but post-regulation photos (1972 and 1994) showed encroachment of robust emergent (Typha angustifolia, T. latifolia, and T. x glauca) in these habitats. Vegetation surveys (7 years, 2001-2007) indicated that reference and treatment sites were dominated by Typha, but mean stem densities were not statistically different. Typha stem density, however, declined in response to decreased summer water level. Periodic summer low water levels coupled with higher winter levels (that promote muskrat activity) were hypothesized to have the greatest effect on reducing Typha density. Seed-bank analysis indicated that a greater diversity of plant species germinated in mesic (moist) conditions than in the saturated treatment (flooded), where Typha was the dominant seedling component. Altered hydrologic regimes and invasive Typha have had a substantial effect on habitat structure within coastal wetlands and inferences from local management of levels provide useful guidance for future system-wide regulation.

J	Tavsanoglu, C				Tavsanoglu, Cagatay			Seed Production and Fruit Parasitism in Cistus salviifolius L. (Cistaceae) along a Post-Fire Successional Gradient	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND VETERINARY ADVANCES												The dynamics of seed production and fruit parasitism in a fire-following obligate seeder species, Cistus salviifolius L. were investigated along a post-fire successional gradient in Marmaris, southwestern Turkey. Four sites of different post-fire age (1, 5,21 and 45 years) were studied for three consecutive years. Fruit samples were collected and plant size was measured in the field. Then fruit infestation rates of individuals and seed numbers of fruits were determined. Mean seed numbers per fruit showed inter-annual variation during the study period and the amount of spring rainfall, especially in March may be responsible for this fluctuation. Mean seed numbers per fruit also showed a decreasing trend with increasing post-fire stand age. This result reflected the seed bank dynamics of Cistus L. in relation to time since fire. Rates of infestation of C. salviifolius by Bruchid beetles were lower however, there were no patterns related to infestation rates except for a negative relationship between mean seed number per fruit and fruit infestation rate. This study indicated that several factors may affect the dynamics of seed production in species of Cistus independent of fire itself such as pre-dispersal seed predators, plant size and spring rainfall.

Contrasting spatial pattern and pattern-forming processes in natural vs. restored shrublands	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												P>1. Variation in the spatial arrangement of plants can lead to differences in the rates and trajectories of change in the composition, structure and function of plant populations and communities. While the ecological significance of spatial interactions has proven difficult to unravel in natural communities, restored ecosystems provide a simplified context for studying this problem. Examining spatial pattern in restoration is therefore useful for both restoration management and ecological theory. 2. We compared 87 plant species patterns at two sites restored after sand-mining in southwestern Australia with 233 patterns at four nearby, species-rich, natural shrubland communities, examining a total of 193 species. Spatial tests were performed for all stems, and for all species with >= 20 individuals in each site, using Ripley's K and pair correlation functions with three null spatial models to characterize observed patterns. 3. The processes and time-scales creating spatial pattern differ between restored and natural vegetation, so we hypothesized that, relative to natural sites, restored sites would have fewer gaps and less aggregation among all stems, fewer species with aggregated patterns, and a lower ratio of cluster- to gradient-aggregated patterns. We also hypothesized differences in pattern between species groups defined by seed size, dispersal, seed bank and regeneration traits, and that these would vary between natural and restored sites. 4. However, relative to natural sites, restored vegetation had lower stem densities, disproportionately higher gap cover and similar patch attributes and mean nearest-neighbour distances. Most species were aggregated, and the fraction of aggregated species in restored sites fell within the range of natural sites. The frequency of aggregation varied little between species groups in restored sites, but strongly in natural sites, being rarer among serotinous and resprouting species. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our spatial results show an important role for gap-creating processes in shrubland restoration development; that particular species groups may be susceptible to disproportionate decline under restoration; and how pattern-creating processes in natural vegetation vary with plant traits. Recommendations for restoration practice include compensatory supplementation of these species groups, research into the development of gaps and awareness of the potential for spatial pattern to influence outcomes.

We asked if these were related to seed limitation or to a lack of safe sites, if topographical heterogeneity affected species patchiness and how species life cycles influence successional trajectories. Location An outwash plain (Skeithararsandur) in southeast Iceland. Methods We identified surface heterogeneity at two different scales, ca. 10-15 cm (larger stones and established plants) and ca. 50 m (shallow depressions representing dry river beds) at two study sites. We quantified species cover, flowering plant density, seed production, seed rain, seed bank density, seedling emergence and seedling survival from June 2005 to June 2007 for the whole plant community, and measured seed production for five species. Results Mean vegetation cover was < 2.5% at the sites. Low emergence rates and high seedling mortality were the two main recruitment filters. Only 1.4% of seedlings emerging in 2005 survived into the 2007 growing season. Topographical heterogeneity had little effect on plant colonisation. High annual variation was recorded, and the two study sites (ca. 2 km apart) differed in their colonisation success. Of the five species, establishment of Cerastium alpinum and Silene uniflora was most limited by lack of seeds, whereas establishment of Luzula spicata, Poa glauca and Rumex acetosella was most limited by safe sites. Conclusions We conclude that colonisation processes and patterns in early primary succession on Skeithararsandur were largely influenced by stochastic factors.

Aerial seed bank dynamics and seedling emergence patterns in two annual Mediterranean Asteraceae	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question We explored the functional significance of seasonal aerial seed banks in two coexisting, heterocarpic annual Asteraceae with dormant (Chrysanthemum coronarium) and non-dormant (Anacyclus radiatus) achenes. We hypothesised that the plant achene pool is a significant component of total seed reserves, and that within-season seedling emergence timing is shaped by achene release patterns. Location SW Spain. Methods In an observational study, we established temporal achene release patterns. We also quantified the aerial and soil achene pools throughout the release season, and assessed seedling emergence timing. Sowing experiments were used to explore the influence of achene release dynamics on emergence timing, and to establish achene morph-specific patterns of between-year distribution of germination. Results Achene release extended from late spring to late autumn (Chrysanthemum), or from early autumn to early winter (Anacyclus). Within species, achene morphs differed in release timing. Only in Chrysanthemum, a small achene fraction seemed to persist in the soil, and between-year germination distribution differed among morphs. In coexisting populations, the Anacyclus plant achene pool was an order of magnitude higher than the soil pool throughout the release season, whereas in Chrysanthemum both pools were of the same magnitude during autumn. Within-year seedling emergence was significantly staggered beneath parent plants compared with the pattern resulting solely from the germination response in soil, with the exception of Chrysanthemum in one of the two study years. Conclusions Results suggest that seasonal aerial seed banks are effective within-season, risk-reducing traits in ruderal Mediterranean habitats characteristic of the study species.

Comparison of seedling emergence and seed extraction techniques for estimating the composition of soil seed banks	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Characterization of the seed bank is one of the most important demographic assessments that can be undertaken for a plant community. Overlapping generations, evidence of past above-ground vegetation and histories of invasion and disturbance are recorded in the seed bank. 2. Two broad approaches have been used to elucidate seed bank components - sifting-sorting techniques and germinability assays. The utility of these approaches varies with community type and habitat although a common theme among studies has been the quest for an efficacious method. Here, we compare the two approaches for semi-arid ephemeral wetlands: seed extraction through flotation and seedling emergence. 3. Species composition of the soil seed bank differed dramatically depending on the technique, with only 19 species common to both methods and a total of 66 species detected using both procedures. 4. Both techniques provided similar estimates of seed density and species richness of the seed bank in the top 5 cm of soil. However, samples collected from 5 cm to 20 cm had lower seed densities using the flotation technique than with the seedling emergence technique. 5. Differences in seed detectability between the two approaches may be related to seed size, seed dormancy and specific germination requirements. 6. The community composition of soil seed banks for ephemeral wetlands depends on the choice of technique.

Experimentally testing the role of foundation species in forests: the Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal Experiment	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												1. Problem statement -Foundation species define and structure ecological systems. In forests around the world, foundation tree species are declining due to overexploitation, pests and pathogens. Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), a foundation tree species in eastern North America, is threatened by an exotic insect, the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae). The loss of hemlock is hypothesized to result in dramatic changes in assemblages of associated species with cascading impacts on food webs and fluxes of energy and nutrients. We describe the setting, design and analytical framework of the Harvard Forest Hemlock Removal Experiment (HF-HeRE), a multi-hectare, long-term experiment that overcomes many of the major logistical and analytical challenges of studying system-wide consequences of foundation species loss. 2. Study design - HF-HeRE is a replicated and blocked Before-After-Control-Impact experiment that includes two hemlock removal treatments: girdling all hemlocks to simulate death by adelgid and logging all hemlocks > 20 cm diameter and other merchantable trees to simulate pre-emptive salvage operations. These treatments are paired with two control treatments: hemlock controls that are beginning to be infested in 2010 by the adelgid and hardwood controls that represent future conditions of most hemlock stands in eastern North America. 3. Ongoing measurements and monitoring - Ongoing long-term measurements to quantify the magnitude and direction of forest ecosystem change as hemlock declines include: air and soil temperature, light availability, leaf area and canopy closure; changes in species composition and abundance of the soil seed-bank, understorey vegetation, and soil-dwelling invertebrates; dynamics of coarse woody debris; soil nitrogen availability and net nitrogen mineralization; and soil carbon flux. Short-term or one-time-only measurements include initial tree ages, hemlock-decomposing fungi, wood-boring beetles and throughfall chemistry. Additional within-plot, replicated experiments include effects of ants and litter-dwelling microarthoropods on ecosystem functioning, and responses of salamanders to canopy change. 4. Future directions and collaborations - HF-HeRE is part of an evolving network of retrospective studies, natural experiments, large manipulations and modelling efforts focused on identifying and understanding the role of single foundation species on ecological processes and dynamics. We invite colleagues from around the world who are interested in exploring complementary questions to take advantage of the HF-HeRE research infrastructure.																	2041-210X	2041-2096				JUN	2010	1	2					168	179		10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00025.x							WOS:000288914100009

The seed banks of English lowland calcareous grasslands along a restoration chronosequence	PLANT ECOLOGY												We investigated whether the seed banks of ex-arable lowland calcareous grasslands underwent restoration similar to that of the above-ground restoration, and whether this was influenced by seed-sowing or environmental conditions. We compared 40 sites, where some form of restoration work had been implemented between 2 and 60 years previously, with 40 paired reference sites of good quality calcareous grassland with no history of ploughing or agricultural improvement. We analysed differences between sites and between above- and below-ground vegetation using both a multivariate approach and proportions of selected plant attributes. Seed banks of reference sites were more characteristic of late successional communities, with attributes such as stress tolerance, perenniality and a reliance on fruit as the germinule form more abundant than in restoration sites. In restoration sites, these tended to decrease with restoration site isolation and increase with restoration site age and where soil nutrient conditions were more similar to reference sites (i.e. with relatively low phosphorus and high nitrogen). Seed bank communities of all sites differed considerably from above-ground communities, however, and no overall significant responses to site age, isolation or soil nutrients were detected by multivariate analyses of similarity of species between pairs of sites. Responses to different seeding methods were also barely detectable. While there is some indication from the plant attribute data that the regeneration potential contained in the seed banks of restored sites increasingly resembles that of references sites over time, even seed banks of good quality calcareous grassland are dominated by ruderal species. It is likely, therefore, that permanent seed banks do not facilitate the restoration of ex-arable grasslands.

J	Ma, JL; Liu, ZM; Zeng, DH; Liu, B				Ma, Junling; Liu, Zhimin; Zeng, Dehui; Liu, Bo			Aerial seed bank in Artemisia species: how it responds to sand mobility	TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION												Aerial seed bank has been found in the arid dune ecosystem. However, the relationship of aerial seed bank to sand mobility intensity is unknown. The adaptation of aerial seed bank to sand mobility was analyzed in four Artemisia species dominating at different habitats in northeastern Inner Mongolia, China. The four species, Artemisia gmelinii, A. frigida, A. halodendron and A. wudanica, are an interdune lowland, stabilized dune, semi-stabilized dune and active dune species, respectively. Seed (achene and capitulum) persistence on the parent plants, the supplement for the soil seed bank, the maintenance of seed viability, and the effect of burial depth on seedling emergence of these four species were studied. Dispersal delay differed interspecifically responding to sand mobility intensity: maximal dispersal was in the following May after maturation for A. wudanica, in the following April after maturation for A. halodendron, and in November of the year of seed maturation for A. frigida and A. gmelinii. The maximal supplement to the soil seed bank for A. wudanica and A. halodendron occurred in the following May and March, respectively. The viability of achenes in aerial seed bank of A. wudanica and A. halodendron maintained at 79.5 and 79.6% until the following May after maturation. This study indicated that aerial seed bank in the sand dune ecosystem functions to postpone seed dispersal until the end of windy season and the start of growing season, and therefore is a mechanism for psammophyte to adapt to sand mobility.																	0931-1890	1432-2285				JUN	2010	24	3					435	441		10.1007/s00468-010-0411-3							WOS:000277645700004

In contrast to our expectations, the degree of genetic diversity at the species level was higher in B. cernua than in B. radiata var. pinnatifida or B. tripartita. At the population level, the degree of genetic diversity was highest in B. cernua. These results may be ascribed to the mating system and method of seedbank formation in B. cernua. An analysis of molecular variance revealed relatively high genetic differentiation among the populations of all three species. We concluded that the distribution width could not be an index of genetic variability in Bidens examined in this study.																	1444-6162					JUN	2010	10	2					113	119		10.1111/j.1445-6664.2010.00374.x							WOS:000278395700005

Characteristics of the soil seed bank in Mediterranean temporary ponds and its role in ecosystem dynamics	WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Species in temporary ponds overcome periods of unfavorable weather conditions by building up a large seed bank. With this strategy, the species diversity of ponds is preserved and information on their dynamics and structure is retained. Little is known about the characteristics, spatial patterns and role in the vegetation dynamics of the soil seed banks of Mediterranean temporary ponds, which are regarded as priority habitats under protection. We studied two sites of western Crete: Omalos, a mountain plateau at 1,060 m a.s.l. and Elafonisos, located near the coast at 60 m a.s.l. The seed bank was surveyed along transects using the germination method. Aboveground vegetation was measured on quadrats along the same transects. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was run to define the zonation patterns. High density and species richness were recorded in both sites, with an average of 75,662 seeds/m(2) found in Omalos and 22,941 seeds/m(2) in Elafonisos. The community composition of both sites was remarkably different but in both locations perennial species were inconspicuous while annuals, prevailed in the seed banks. An important array of protected or rare species as well as several others which were absent from the vegetation were hosted in the soil seed banks, thereby rendering a low similarity between their composition. Soil seed banks in these ecosystems indicated a spatial heterogeneity that mirrored the aboveground vegetation distribution, sorted along the moisture gradient by their tolerance to flooding. Soil seed banks play a key role in the vegetation recovery after summer drought. The acts of preserving the soil seed bank and ensuring a transient flooding regime are essential to protect the unique vegetation communities of Mediterranean temporary ponds.

J	Wang, J; Li, DY; Ren, H; Yang, L				Wang, Jun; Li, Danyan; Ren, Hai; Yang, Long			Seed supply and the regeneration potential for plantations and shrubland in southern China	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Assessing the characteristics of seed supply will be vital to better understand the dynamics of forest regeneration. In this study, we surveyed the aboveground vegetation, the seed rain, the seed bank, and natural seedling emergence in four typical 24-year-old plantations (eucalyptus, mixed-native, mixed-legume, and mixed-conifer) and a naturally successioned shrubland in southern China. The dominant species in the understory were similar among the five plant communities. The seed rain and the seed bank were dominated by shrubs and herbs but indigenous tree species were rare. Species that were common to all five-plant communities represented a great proportion of the seeds in the seed rain and seed bank. The seed rain consisted mostly of seeds derived from the local plant community. Seed abundance was greater in the seed bank than in the seed rain, and species richness was greater in the seed bank and in the corresponding plant community than in the seed rain. Species composition similarity between the seed rain, the seed bank, and the aboveground vegetation was low, because the seed rain contained much fewer species, and the seed bank and aboveground vegetation contained many different species, respectively. These findings indicate that both the seed rain and the seed bank play important roles in providing seeds for plant recruitment in the understory, but the seed bank contributes more than the current seed rain to the diversity of recruited plants. The current plant community has little impact on the qualitative composition of the seed rain and seed bank. Based on these data, it appears that succession to the desired zonal, mature forest community is unlikely to result from seeds in the seed rain or seed bank. Lack of seed availability of desired zonal mature forest species is the main bottleneck currently limiting succession in the plantations. Reintroduction of late-successional species could facilitate the desired succession. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

This has resulted in a decline in the genetic diversity of agriculturally used wheat. However, the diversity lost in the elite material is somewhat preserved in crop gene banks. Therefore, the gene bank accessions provide the basis for genetic improvement of crops for specific traits and and represent rich sources of novel allelic variation. Results: We have undertaken large scale molecular allele mining to isolate new alleles of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3 from wheat gene bank accessions. The search for new Pm3 alleles was carried out on a geographically diverse set of 733 wheat accessions originating from 20 countries. Pm3 specific molecular tools as well as classical pathogenicity tests were used to characterize the accessions. Two new functional Pm3 alleles were identified out of the eight newly cloned Pm3 sequences. These new resistance alleles were isolated from accessions from China and Nepal. Thus, the repertoire of functional Pm3 alleles now includes 17 genes, making it one of the largest allelic series of plant resistance genes. The combined information on resistant and susceptible Pm3 sequences will allow to study molecular function and specificity of functional Pm3 alleles. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that molecular allele mining on geographically defined accessions is a useful strategy to rapidly characterize the diversity of gene bank accessions at a specific genetic locus of agronomical importance. The identified wheat accessions with new resistance specificities can be used for marker-assisted transfer of the Pm3 alleles to modern wheat lines.

J	Rands, SA; Whitney, HM				Rands, Sean A.; Whitney, Heather M.			Effects of pollinator density-dependent preferences on field margin visitations in the midst of agricultural monocultures: A modelling approach	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Managed field margins offer a means of reducing the impact of agricultural monocultures within intensively managed environments. By providing refuge for wild plants and the pollinators associated with them, field margins can also contribute to enhancing the pollination services within the monoculture. However, the effects of the monoculture on pollinator behaviour need to be carefully considered. It is known that pollinators may show density-dependent preferences such as neophobia (an avoidance of unfamiliar items) when different types of flower are available within their environment, and the dominance of monoculture crops within the environment may consequently have adverse effects upon the preferences shown by pollinators living in the field margins within them. In order to examine how pollinator preferences for wild flowers are affected by monocultures, we modelled the effects of density-dependent preferences, flower densities, and the geometry of field margins within a monoculture landscape using numerical simulations. This was done by considering how the placement of pollinator nests within a simple, spatially explicit landscape consisting of fields of monoculture crops separated by margins containing wild flowers affected the ratio of wild and monoculture crops experienced by the pollinator, given that it could only forage within a limited distance from its nest. Increasing field margin width and decreasing monoculture field width both led to an increase in pollinators visiting wild flowers (which levelled off as width increased). The size of the monoculture fields had little additional effect once they had passed an intermediate width. Increasing wild flower density within the margins led to a shift away from preferring monocultures. When wild flowers were at low densities compared to the monoculture, even the addition of small amounts of extra wild flowers had a large effect in shifting foraging preferences away from the monoculture. The distance which pollinators normally forage over only has an effect upon preferences for wild flowers when the travel distance is small. This suggests that careful consideration of margin design might be extremely important for those species which do not travel far. Innate preferences for density-dependence and particular crop types may also have an effect on preference behaviour. We demonstrate that the way in which resources are presented to indigenous pollinators may be extremely important in influencing where they choose to forage within agricultural landscapes. Careful margin design, as well as increasing the density of wild flowers (such as by enhancing the wild seed bank within the margins), may lead to overall improvements in ecosystem function within intensively farmed monocultures.

J	Godefroid, S; Van de Vyver, A; Vanderborght, T				Godefroid, Sandrine; Van de Vyver, Ann; Vanderborght, Thierry			Germination capacity and viability of threatened species collections in seed banks	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Facing the current biodiversity crisis, the value of ex situ conservation has been increasingly acknowledged in international treaties and legislations. Seed banks are a good way of conserving biodiversity, providing that seeds are of high quality and at maximum viability. However, despite the number of established ex situ facilities, there is little information on seed viability in botanic garden seed banks. This paper analyses the status of the seed collection of the National Botanic Garden of Belgium by determining the germination capacity and viability of seeds that have been stored for 1-26 years. It aims at: (1) ensuring that existing storage conditions provide effective ex situ conservation of threatened species; (2) providing viability data on threatened species; (3) planning future collection and storage efforts for seeds of West European species of conservation value. Results from this study showed that the germination and viability percentages of the 250 tested species reached on average 59 and 79% respectively. Some families typically performed better than others. Within a species, consistent results were not always obtained. Over a quarter of accessions exhibited some degree of dormancy. Considering the current lack of knowledge in seed germination and dormancy of many rare and threatened species, we believe that the quality of a seed collection should be estimated by its viability and not by its germination percentage.

Bieb.; Apiaceae) is an annual naturalized herb introduced from Europe at least 120 years ago. Anthriscus is distributed in vegetation formations such as sclerophyllous shrublands (locally known as "matorral") and spiny savannas of Acacia caven (locally known as "espinal"). In matorral formations, Anthriscus grows at the edge of native woody fragments. Because these fragments are refuges where native herbs recruit, we studied the impact of Anthriscus on the diversity and survival of native forbs established in these sheltering microsites. First, we characterized the spatial distribution of Anthriscus in the matorral, sampling in different micro-habitat types. We differentiated three microhabitat types: under the canopy of a fragment, at the edge of the canopy of a fragment, and in open sites outside the fragments. A total of 40 1 x 1 m quadrates were randomly distributed in each habitat type. Inside each of them, we recorded the number of seedlings and established plants, including Anthriscus. Then we evaluated experimentally the effect of Anthriscus on diversity and evenness of the local herb assemblages. For this purpose we conducted a field trial using 34 metallic enclosures (0.5 x 0.5 m) arranged in pairs. In each pair, Anthriscus individuals were removed from one plot, the other paired plot acting as control. We periodically recorded the presence and abundance of the remanent species of herbs inside the plots, and then we characterized the species diversity and evenness over time (Shannon's index, H' and Pielou's index, J'). Finally, in a second experiment we measured experimentally the presence or absence of Anthriscus against the survival of four native herb species (Bowlesia incana, Bromus berteroanus, Pectocarya linearis, and Moscharia pinnatifida). Here we used 20 0.5 x 0.5 m plots where we randomly transplanted seedlings of native herbs and Arnthiscus. Then, for each species and plot we determined their survival (%) according to the number of seedlings initially transplanted. The samplings show strong association between the presence of Anthriscus on edge habitat in the matorral. The maximum densities were noted in these microhabitat types whereas in open areas and under-fragment sites Anthriscus shows very low or null densities. At the end of the first trials, the plots with Anthriscus showed a Shannon diversity index H' = 0.41 (+/- 0.11 SE), while in plots without Anthriscus this value was 1.19 (+/- 0.1 SE), both as averages. Pielou's evenness index (J') yielded values of 0.23 (+/- 0.06 SE) and 0.59 (+/- 0.04 SE) for treatments with and without Anthriscus, respectively. Similarly, the second trials shows that the survival of the four native herbs was drastically decreased in the presence of Anthriscus: by 64% for Bowlesia incana, 43% for Bromus berteroanus, 46% for Moscharia pinnatifida, and 76% for Pectocaria linearis. Our study shows that the effects of Anthriscus include an inhibition of the establishment of native plants and a decrease in their survival in edge habitats, therefore affecting the composition and diversity of the local herb layer. Thus, Anthriscus is invading a refuge habitat for native herbs in the Chilean matorral, decreasing the native herb diversity and survival.

Boccanelli, E. Pire, and J. Lewis. 2010. Vegetation changes after 15 years of abandonment of crop fields in the Pampas Region (Argentina). Cien. Inv. Agr. 37(2): 45-53. Agriculture has been practised in the Argentine Pampa Region for more than a century. This long history of disturbance has strongly modified the native vegetation of the region. Some original species have disappeared or its area has been remarkably reduced. The objective was to evaluate vegetation changes over time after the abandonment of agriculture practice. Our hypothesis was that over time vegetation in this region will evolve towards a "flechillar" (Stipa spp. community) similar to the original vegetation. The experiment was conducted at Zavalla (Santa Fe) Argentina (33 degrees 01' S, 60 degrees 53' W and 50 m.a.s.l.). Vegetation evolution was studied during 15 years (1982-1997) after abandonment, considering four initial crop situations (i.e. wheat, soybean, pasture and tillage). Periodically, we measured species cover and abundance in 60 subplots. Data was analyzed using multivariate methods. We identified several groups corresponding to two very well defined successional stages. The first group was very small, and showed predominance of annual species; the second group showed a reduction or almost disappearance of annuals and an increase in perennials such as Baccharis salicifolia (Ruiz & Pay.) Pers. and Sorghum halepense (L.) Pers. accompanied by Carduus acanthoides L. Therefore, a secondary succession was developed, with a first stage of annual species dominance followed by long life cycle species. However, even after 15 years there was no reversion of the vegetation to the original community.																	0718-1620					MAY-AUG	2010	37	2					45	53									WOS:000281310300005

Persistence of an oilseed rape transgene in the environment	CROP PROTECTION												Transgenic bromoxynil (BX)-resistant spring oilseed rape (Brassica napus L) was grown commercially in Canada only for two crop seasons - 2000 and 2001. We investigated the persistence of suspected BX-resistant oilseed rape volunteers in a 64-ha wheat field in Saskatchewan, Canada in 2007, 7 years after the BX-resistant cultivar BX Armor was grown. A small oilseed rape volunteer population, estimated at less than 100 plants, was observed in three main areas or patches in the field. These patches were located in low-lying areas that were too wet to plant or spray with herbicides in 2007. Viable seed was collected from 35 mature volunteers and F(1) progeny screened with BX at 280 g ai/ha in the greenhouse. Progeny of all of the volunteers were visually rated as BX-resistant; the presence of the Oxy 235 transgene in leaf tissue of progeny of all volunteers was confirmed by PCR analysis. This study has documented the longest persistence of oilseed rape volunteers in Canada. Volunteers were not observed in 2008 or 2009, because of drought conditions in spring of both years. Results support the findings from previous studies that persistence of volunteer oilseed rape populations in western Canada is generally ephemeral or transitory in the absence of seed bank immigration. However, this study shows that oilseed rape transgenes can persist in the environment for a number of years even after all cultivars with the conferred trait are removed from the market.

J	Kirchman, DL; Cottrell, MT; Lovejoy, C				Kirchman, David L.; Cottrell, Matthew T.; Lovejoy, Connie			The structure of bacterial communities in the western Arctic Ocean as revealed by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												P>Bacterial communities in the surface layer of the oceans consist of a few abundant phylotypes and many rare ones, most with unknown ecological functions and unclear roles in biogeochemical processes. To test hypotheses about relationships between abundant and rare phylotypes, we examined bacterial communities in the western Arctic Ocean using pyrosequence data of the V6 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Samples were collected from various locations in the Chukchi Sea, the Beaufort Sea and Franklin Bay in summer and winter. We found that bacterial communities differed between summer and winter at a few locations, but overall there was no significant difference between the two seasons in spite of large differences in biogeochemical properties. The sequence data suggested that abundant phylotypes remained abundant while rare phylotypes remained rare between the two seasons and among the Arctic regions examined here, arguing against the 'seed bank' hypothesis. Phylotype richness was calculated for various bacterial groups defined by sequence similarity or by phylogeny (phyla and proteobacterial classes). Abundant bacterial groups had higher within-group diversity than rare groups, suggesting that the ecological success of a bacterial lineage depends on diversity rather than on the dominance of a few phylotypes. In these Arctic waters, in spite of dramatic variation in several biogeochemical properties, bacterial community structure was remarkably stable over time and among regions, and any variation was due to the abundant phylotypes rather than rare ones.

J	Yang, ZB; Jin, HX; Wang, G				Yang, Zhanbiao; Jin, Hongxi; Wang, Gang			An assessment of restoration success to forests planted for ecosystem restoration in loess plateau, Northwestern China	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Using ecosystem attributes identified by the Society of Ecological Restoration International, we assessed three restoration projects in the loess plateau, northwestern China, including planting Larix principis-rupprechtii (LS) and Pinus tabulaeformis (PS) on shrubland, and planting L. principis-rupprechtii on open forest land (LO). The reestablishment of native species in LS and PS was poorer than LO because of the excessive stand density. Species diversity, seedling number, and seedling diversity were significantly higher in LO than in LS and PS. Soil nutrient was also significantly higher in the LO treatment. The vegetation composition, species diversity, and soil nutrient in LO, however, were more similar to these in the reference. Our results indicate that planting L. principis-rupprechtii on open forest land had accelerated the succession of the ecosystem for approximately 30 years. But the poor natural regeneration of L. principis-rupprechtii suggests that post-planting activities in LO are required after timber harvesting or the natural mortality of the L. principis-rupprechtii. Management operation such as selective thinning will be required in LS and PS to promote the true restoration of native species diversity in the future.																	0167-6369					MAY	2010	164	1-4					357	368		10.1007/s10661-009-0898-5							WOS:000276655700030	19373438					
J	Arnaud, JF; Fenart, S; Cordellier, M; Cuguen, J				Arnaud, Jean-Francois; Fenart, Stephane; Cordellier, Mathilde; Cuguen, Joel			Populations of weedy crop-wild hybrid beets show contrasting variation in mating system and population genetic structure	EVOLUTIONARY APPLICATIONS												Reproductive traits are key parameters for the evolution of invasiveness in weedy crop-wild hybrids. In Beta vulgaris, cultivated beets hybridize with their wild relatives in the seed production areas, giving rise to crop-wild hybrid weed beets. We investigated the genetic structure, the variation in first-year flowering and the variation in mating system among weed beet populations occurring within sugar beet production fields. No spatial genetic structure was found for first-year populations composed of F1 crop-wild hybrid beets. In contrast, populations composed of backcrossed weed beets emerging from the seed bank showed a strong isolation-by-distance pattern. Whereas gametophytic self-incompatibility prevents selfing in wild beet populations, all studied weed beet populations had a mixed-mating system, plausibly because of the introgression of the crop-derived Sf gene that disrupts self-incompatibility. No significant relationship between outcrossing rate and local weed beet density was found, suggesting no trends for a shift in the mating system because of environmental effects. We further reveal that increased invasiveness of weed beets may stem from positive selection on first-year flowering induction depending on the B gene inherited from the wild. Finally, we discuss the practical and applied consequences of our findings for crop-weed management.

Dormancy, germination and seed bank storage: a study in support of ex situ conservation of macrophytes of southwest Australian temporary pools	FRESHWATER BIOLOGY												1. Vernal pools and rock pools (gnammas) in the Southwest Australian Floristic Region are forms of temporary wetlands that are under threat. Some of their aquatic macrophytes are rare and/or endemic, and there is a need to develop off-site seed banks to assure their conservation. Here, we report results of the first comprehensive study of the seed germination, dormancy and seed storage behaviour of nine indigenous macrophyte species. 2. Seeds of Glossostigma drummondii, Myriophyllum balladoniense, M. lapidicola, M. petreaum and Triglochin linearis were non-dormant, whereas those of Damasonium minus, Glossostigma sp. (currently undescribed), G. trichodes and Myriophyllum crispatum were dormant. Non-dormant seeds germinated over a range of temperatures (5-20 degrees C) but temperatures at which highest germination occurred were species specific. All species demonstrated a germination preference for the light. Warm stratification substantially increased germination of dormant Glossostigma trichodes seeds and all dormancy-breaking treatments partially overcame dormancy in Glossostigma spp. 3. Seeds possessed orthodox storage behaviour (tolerating drying to 5% moisture content and storage at -18 degrees C) and are thus amenable to seed banking as a means of ex situ conservation. 4. It appears that seeds of most species are able to germinate upon inundation as long as they are situated at the soil surface. Thus, species are opportunistic and respond to the first rains of the season providing prompt ecological cuing in an environment vulnerable to rapid drying events. Maintaining the integrity of the soil crust may be an important first step for on-site conservation if seeds are in the superficial layers.				Hopper, Stephen D/G-4222-2012; AC, Stephen D.

We simulated two key components of severe hurricane disturbance, canopy openness and detritus deposition, to determine the independent and interactive effects of these components on woody plant recruitment and forest structure. 2. We increased canopy openness by trimming branches and added or subtracted canopy detritus in a factorial design. Plant responses were measured during the 4-year study, which followed at least 1 year of pre-manipulation monitoring. 3. The physical conditions of canopy openness and detritus deposition in our experiment resembled the responses to Hurricane Hugo, a severe category 4 hurricane that struck this forest in 1989. 4. Canopy detritus deposition killed existing woody seedlings and provided a mechanical barrier that suppressed seedling recruitment. The increase in understorey light caused by canopy trimming stimulated germination from the seed bank and increased seedling recruitment and density of pioneer species several hundred-fold when hurricane debris was absent. Many significant interactions between trimming and detritus deposition were evident from the manner in which seedling density, recruitment and mortality changed over time, and subsequently influenced the composition of woody stems (individuals >= 1 cm d.b.h.). 5. When the canopy was trimmed, stem densities increased > 2-fold and rates of recruitment into the stem size class increased > 25-fold. Trimming had no significant effect on stem mortality. The two dominant species that flourished following canopy trimming were the pioneer species Cecropia schreberiana and Psychotria berteriana. Deposition of canopy detritus had little effect on stems, although basal area increased slightly when detritus was added. There were no evident effects of the interactions between canopy trimming and detritus deposition on stems. 6. Synthesis. The separate and interactive effects of canopy openness and detritus deposition result in variable short-term trajectories of forest recovery. However, the short interval of increased canopy openness due to hurricane impacts and its influence on the recruitment of pioneer trees is the dominant factor that drives short-term recovery and may alter long-term structure and composition of the forest.

In this study, we explore with simulations the effect of disturbance regime on population dynamics and viability. We collected 7 years of demographic data in three populations of the perennial herb Primula farinosa, and used these data to examine how variation in vital rates affected population viability parameters (stochastic growth rate, lambda(S)), and how vital rates were related to weather conditions. Elasticity analysis indicated that the stochastic growth rate was very sensitive to changes in regeneration, quantified as the production, survival, and germination of seeds. In one of the study years, all seedlings and mature plants in the demography plots died. This extinction coincided with the driest summer during the study period. Simulations suggested that a future increase in the frequency of high-mortality years due to climate change would result in reduced population growth rate, and an increased importance of survival in the seed bank for population viability. The results illustrate how the limited demographic data typically available for many natural systems can be used in simulation models to assess how environmental change will affect population viability.

J	Satterthwaite, WH				Satterthwaite, William H.			Competition for space can drive the evolution of dormancy in a temporally invariant environment	PLANT ECOLOGY												I present a model for the evolution of a seed bank in the absence of externally driven environmental variation. I use Evolutionarily Stable Strategy (ESS) analyses of both analytic and simulation models to assess the conditions under which a dormant genotype can invade and resist invasion. In my models, plant seeds compete through lottery for discrete safe sites holding one individual each. Analyzing the conditions under which a dormant genotype can invade when rare and resist invasion once established, I conclude that dormancy can be an ESS when some fraction of seeds is retained locally, seed bank survival is high, and mortality in the seed bank is low. The advantage of dormancy stems from the ability of dormant seeds to recapture a lost site and the fact that a plant's offspring are more likely to win the lottery in its own site than in any new site. The advantage of dormancy does not depend on individual fecundity or on low relatedness with the offspring of kin, making this mechanism distinct from earlier models of sib competition.

J	Batlla, D; Benech-Arnold, RL				Batlla, Diego; Luis Benech-Arnold, Roberto			Predicting changes in dormancy level in natural seed soil banks	PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY												The possibility of accurately predicting timing and extent of seedling emergence from natural seed soil banks has long been an objective of both ecologist and agriculturalist. However, as dormancy is a common attribute of many wild seed populations, we should first be able to predict dormancy changes if we intend to predict seedling emergence in the field. In this paper, we discuss the most relevant environmental factors affecting seed dormancy of natural seed soil banks, and present a conceptual framework as an attempt to understand how these factors affect seed-bank dormancy level. Based on this conceptual framework we show approaches that can be used to establish quantitative functional relationship between environmental factors regulating dormancy and changes in the seed-bank dormancy status. Finally, we briefly explain how we can utilize population-based threshold models as a framework to characterize and quantify changes in seed sensitivity to environmental factors as a consequence of dormancy loss and/or induction.																	0167-4412	1573-5028				MAY	2010	73	1-2			SI		3	13		10.1007/s11103-010-9601-z							WOS:000276440900002	20091421

Although successional processes usually lead to rapid restoration of abandoned fields, the invasive fern, Pteridium aquilinium (commonly known as Bracken), can block natural succession. The Lacandon are aware of this and use the fast-growing tree Balsa (Ochroma pyramidale) to accelerate succession toward mature forest. We carried out a 12-month-long experiment in a Bracken-infested area to test the effectiveness of the Lacandon's low-input restoration techniques. We found that we could successfully establish Balsa in plots dominated by Bracken using the Lacandon methodology. Their technique involves broadcasting large numbers of small seeds and applying traditional weeding techniques. After 12 months' growth, Balsa reached a top height of over 6 m and basal areas of 4.1 (+/- 0.3) m2/ha. We contrasted this low-cost traditional fallow management with more costly techniques involving transplanting Balsa seedlings and sowing directly in the experimental area. The results validated the effectiveness of the Lacandon method for directing succession and confirmed the general potential of Balsa as a facilitator in the restoration of degraded tropical forest areas.

CREATION OF A HIGH-YIELDING RECOMBINANT MAIZE HYBRID FOR THE PRODUCTION OF A MICROBICIDE TO PREVENT HIV-1 TRANSMISSION	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												The aim of this study was to use conventional breeding to increase the production in maize of the human monoclonal antibody 2G12, known to have potential therapeutic properties in the prevention of HIV-1 transmission. The recombinant antibody, together with a fluorescent marker, was introduced into two South African high-performing maize elite inbred lines by crossing them with a transgenic maize line that had been transformed with the monoclonal antibody 2G12. The effect of breeding to produce high-expressing recombinant hybrid seed was evaluated by comparing 2G12 production in the different breeding lines with the original maize line. 'Good production practice standards' were followed throughout the breeding programme. 'Conventional drug regulations' adapted to plant-made pharmaceuticals were also followed, with the seeds being stored in a 'master seed bank'. The maize hybrid expressed a higher level of the antibody than the recombinant maize elite lines. This plant-derived antibody provides a means of producing a microbicide component that could be used with other HIV-neutralising antibodies as an additional approach to prevent HIV infection.																	0038-2353					MAY-JUN	2010	106	5-6					77	81		10.4102/sajs.v106i5/6.225							WOS:000281421400014

Secondary old-field succession in an ecosystem with restrictive soils: does time from abandonment matter?	APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE												Question Our knowledge of secondary old-field succession in Mediterranean environments is extremely poor and is non-existent for restrictive soil conditions. How these ecosystems, such as those on semi-arid gypsum outcrops, recover seems a priority for managing change and for ensuring conservation of specialized and endangered biota. We tested whether reinstallation of gypsum vegetation after cropland abandonment requires: (1) soil physical restructuring and (2) chemical readjustment to enable growth and survival of specialized gypsophilous vegetation, and more specifically how time from abandonment drives such environmental change. Location We sampled a complete set of old fields on gypsum soils (1-60 yr since abandonment) in Villarrubia de Santiago (Toledo, Spain). Methods Generalized linear models and model comparisons were used to analyse the effect of several environmental parameters on species abundance and richness. Ordination methods (canonical correspondence analyses and partial canonical correspondence analyses) were undertaken to evaluate compositional variation among the sampled fields. Results Secondary old-field succession on semi-arid Mediterranean gypsum soils was controlled by a complex set of factors acting relatively independently. Surprisingly, time since abandonment explains only a small proportion of compositional variation (3%). Conversely, soil chemical features independently from time since abandonment are important for explaining differences found in old-field composition. Conclusions Secondary succession on specialized Mediterranean soils does not follow the widely described "amelioration" process in which soil features and composition are closely related over time. Restrictive soil conditions control both structure and functioning of mature communities and also secondary succession.

The mean live biomass and species richness of submerged vegetation was significantly reduced or absent in lake-culture lakes (0-159 g m(-2) and 0-0.3 species per sample, respectively), compared to those with pen-culture lakes (1552-2971 g m(-2) and 1.5-3.2 species per sample, respectively) in all three study years. Also mean seedling density and species richness of seed banks were significantly lower in these lake-culture lakes (133 m(-2) vs. 265 m(-2) and 0.6 species vs. 0.9 species per sample, respectively). These results suggest that intensive aquaculture in these lakes has had serious negative effects on submerged vegetation and the associated seed banks. Vegetation history was partly reflected by distribution patterns of seed banks across sediment depth strata. A principal component analysis produced a very clear separation of lakes from pen-culture and lake-culture on the basis of their species composition. Moreover, the principal component analysis also indicated that the variation in the soil seed bank corresponded poorly with vegetation data. This probably reflects species-specific strategies for seed production. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Ecological effects on estimates of effective population size in an annual plant	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												Effective population size (N(e)) is a critical indicator of the vulnerability of a population to allele loss via genetic drift, and it can also be used to assess the evolutionary potential of a population While some plant conservation plans have focused on outcrossing through cross-pollination as a way to Increase estimated N(e), variance in reproductive output determined by ecological factors such as competition can also strongly affect estimated N(e). We examined the effects of intraspecific and interspecific competition, stressful soils, and local adaptation on estimates of N(e) in an annual plant species. While ecological influences on plant growth rate variance have been predicted to influence estimates of N(e)/N, we found a significant effect on the estimate of N(e)/N. but no significant ecological effects on growth rate variance. Lower survivorship on stressful soil was the most important effect reducing estimates of N(e)/N. If stochastic mortality is greater in environments that are abiotically stressful, then populations in these stressful environments may be slower to adapt because of lower census sizes and reduction of N(e)/N. In populations of conservation concern, increasing survivorship may be of greater benefit for maximizing N(e) than the reduction of variability in reproductive output among surviving adults.

The pmoA gene was used as a functional and phylogenetic marker for MOB in two approaches: (i) a pmoA database (> 4000 sequences) was evaluated to obtain insights into MOB diversity in Italian rice paddies, and paddy fields worldwide. The results show a wide geographical distribution of pmoA genotypes that seem to be specifically adapted to paddy fields (e.g. Rice Paddy Cluster 1 and Rice Paddy Cluster 2). (ii) On the smaller geographical scale, we designed a factorial experiment including three different locations, two rice varieties and two habitats (soil and roots) within each of three rice fields. Multivariate analysis of terminal restriction fragment analysis profiles revealed different community patterns at the three field sites, located 10-20 km apart. Root samples were characterized by high abundance of type I MOB whereas the rice variety had no effect. With the agronomical practice being nearly identical, historical contingencies might be responsible for the field site differences. Considering a large reservoir of viable yet inactive MOB cells acting as a microbial seed bank, environmental conditions might have selected and activated a different subset at a time thereby shaping the community.

Genetic diversity associated with conservation of endangered Dongxiang wild rice (Oryza rufipogon)	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION												The wild progenitor species (Oryza rufipogon) of Asian cultivated rice (O. sativa L.) is located in Dongxiang county, China which is considered its the northernmost range worldwide. Nine ex situ and three in situ populations of the Dongxiang wild rice (DXWR) and four groups of modern cultivars were genotyped using 21 SSR markers for study of population structure, conservation efficiency and genetic relationship. We demonstrated that the ex situ conservation of the DXWR failed to maintain the genetic identity and reduced genetic diversity. Therefore, in situ conservation is absolutely necessary to maintain the genetic identity, diversity and heterozygosity. Also, in situ conservation is urgently needed because natural populations in DXWR have decreased from nine to three at present due to farming activity and urban expansion. In DXWR, the three surviving in situ populations had greater expected heterozygosity than any cultivated rice, and were genetically closer to japonica than either the male-sterile maintainer or restorer lines, or indica. Japonica has the lowest genetic diversity of cultivated rice. As a result, DXWR is a rich gene pool and is especially valuable for genetic improvement of japonica rice because these O. rufipogon accessions are most closely related to the japonica as compared to O. rufipogon collected anywhere else in the world.

Foraging pits, litter and plant germination in an arid shrubland	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												Many animals create soil surface depressions (pits) while foraging for subterranean resources. Foraging pits typically fill with litter, organic debris and seed, retain Moisture, and become hotspots for plant germination. This study aimed to examine whether artificial foraging pits, which mimic those created by Greater bilbies (Macrotis lagotis) and Burrowing bettongs (Bettongia lesueur), develop into patches of enhanced plant germination due to accumulation of leaf litter, or whether physical characteristics of the pits such as temperature and soil moisture influence germination, irrespective of the presence of litter. Compared with the soil surface, significantly more plants germinated in artificially-created foraging pits, irrespective of whether they received added litter. Daytime temperatures were 17-31% (7-11 degrees C) cooler in foraging pits than on the adjacent soil surface, and pits retained significantly more moisture up to 5 days after rainfall. Our results suggest that the mesic conditions in foraging pits may be more important in promoting germination of vascular plants than the presence of litter. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

However, soil seed bank, one of regeneration strategies, is poorly understood in gaps of secondary forests. Objectives of the study were to evaluate the effects of sizes of experimentally created gaps on seed distribution in soil, and of seed banks on vegetation recovery at early formation stage of gaps in temperate secondary forests, Northeast China. It was found that with increasing gap size, species richness in the seed bank significantly increased (r = 0.691, P < 0.05, n = 10), but correspondence in species-composition of seed reservoir between gaps and canopies adjacent to gaps decreased (r = -0.83, P < 0.01, n = 10). Gap size and soil depth and their two-way interactions had significant differences on the distribution of seed bank density (F = 4.101, P < 0.05; F = 34.483, P < 0.01; F = 5.232, P < 0.01, respectively). The Sokal and Sneath similarity indices in species-composition between extant and potential (seed bank) vegetation were generally low, ranging from 0.06 (interior of large gaps) to 0.24 (canopies adjacent to large gaps). From the view of seed bank to restore temperate secondary forests, establishment of medium-sized artificial gaps (i.e., gap size with 500-150 m(2)) could be more feasible for seed invasion. To conclude, the regeneration potential out of soil seed banks is limited, and the restoration of gaps at early formation stage may be mostly dependent on other reproductive strategies (e.g., vegetative propagation of species).

Today, these low-intensity farming systems are threatened by the cessation of traditional management regimes, such as grazing and prescribed burning. In natural systems, the effects of fire on germination responses are often explained by adaptation to fire over extended periods of time. However, Northern heathlands are semi-natural systems with only a limited fire history. We investigated whether and how the keystone species in this system, Calluna vulgaris, responded to prescribed burning, based on previous findings where Calluna germinable seed-bank densities showed a pronounced peak right after fire. Our main findings were (i) an ecophysiological response to smoke; (ii) a potential explanation for this pattern, revealed by a seed-bank experiment where we managed to re-create the germination pattern experimentally by using an aqueous plant-derived smoke solution; and (iii) a history of anthropogenic use of fire and the development of heathlands in the region documented through palaeoecological investigations.

Large-scale grazing history effects on Arctic-alpine germinable seed banks	PLANT ECOLOGY												Grazing constitutes a selective pressure on vegetation recruitment through modification of the seed banks. Here we address changes in seed bank density and its life history trait composition in century-old pastures, where contrasting reindeer densities have developed during the last decades. We cover the actual scales used by these wide-roaming herbivores by sampling 70 productive tundra habitats over 7,421 km(2) in the reindeer summer pastures of Northern Norway. Results showed that the seed bank density was significantly lowered where reindeer densities had increased in recent decades, whereas the century-long history of grazing probably explains the main seed bank traits typical of grazing tolerant plants. The dominant trait characteristics were small seeds (< 0.5 mg), seeds lacking dispersal mechanism and individuals with a graminoid growth form. Finally, differences between regions introduced trait variation independent of grazing history, reinforcing the importance of using scales covering several contexts when designing ecological studies.

Germination and Early Growth of Slickspot Peppergrass (Lepidium papilliferum) as Affected by Desert Soil Humic Acids	SOIL SCIENCE												Slickspot peppergrass (Lepidium papilliferum) is a biennial, or possibly perennial, endemic plant growing in the Southern Idaho high desert in visually distinct small-scale depressions in soils that collect water (so-called slickspots). Lepidium papilliferum establishes seed banks not germinating the first year but remaining dormant and viable for several years. Humic acids (HA) are universally considered to be the most important, abundant, and biologically and chemically active fractions of soil organic matter and are known to affect plant growth by various mechanisms, depending on their origin, nature, and concentration. The effects of HA in slickspot soils and how they relate to the possibility of being a factor in restoring native plants is only partially known. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify and evaluate the effects of HA isolated from three different layers within the soil pro. le (silt, vesicular, and clay) from inside a representative slickspot on the germination and early growth of slickspot peppergrass. Furthermore, these effects were tentatively related to the chemical, physicochemical, compositional, structural, and functional characteristics of the HA. Results of statistical analysis showed that both the type and concentration of the three HA examined exert a highly significant or significant effect on the germination and early growth of slickspot peppergrass as a function of the soil depth from which the HA originated in the slickspot. In particular, germination seemed to be enhanced, especially at higher concentrations, by the less hydrophobic HA, rich in oxygen and total sugars, present in the bottom clay soil layer, whereas root growth and shoot growth were positively influenced by the more hydrophobic and probably more polycondensed HA, rich in C, H, N, and phenolic OH present in the top layer rich in silt.

Assessment of genetic diversity of accessions in Brassicaceae genetic resources by frequency distribution analysis of S haplotypes	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS												Plant genetic resources are important sources of genetic variation for improving crop varieties as breeding materials. Conservation of such resources of allogamous species requires maintenance of the genetic diversity within each accession to avoid inbreeding depression and loss of rare alleles. For assessment of genetic diversity in the self-incompatibility locus (S locus), which is critically involved in the chance of mating, we developed a dot-blot genotyping method for self-incompatibility (S) haplotypes and applied it to indigenous, miscellaneous landraces of Brassica rapa, provided by the IPK Gene Bank (Gatersleben, Germany) and the Tohoku University Brassica Seed Bank (Sendai, Japan), in which landraces are maintained using different population sizes. This method effectively determined S genotypes of more than 500 individuals from the focal landraces. Although our results suggest that these landraces might possess sufficient numbers of S haplotypes, the strong reduction of frequencies of recessive S haplotypes occurred, probably owing to genetic drift. Based on these results, we herein discuss an appropriate way to conserve genetic diversity of allogamous plant resources in a gene bank.																	0040-5752	1432-2242				APR	2010	120	6					1129	1138		10.1007/s00122-009-1240-x							WOS:000275661300007	20039015

PIM (Poppy Integrated Management): a bio-economic decision support model for the management of Papaver rhoeas in rain-fed cropping systems	WEED RESEARCH												P>A bio-economic model for Papaver rhoeas designed for dry-land cropping systems in Spain was developed. The model included four seed bank layers to simulate seed movement in the soil profile resulting from tillage, with different emergence rates and seed bank mortalities depending on soil cultivation and burial depth. Users of Poppy Integrated Management (PIM) might specify the crop sequence and any feasible combination of 38 different weed management practices (herbicide and non-herbicide options) each year over 10 or 20 years. Weed treatment options included selective herbicides (14), non-selective herbicides (1), non-herbicide treatments (11) and user-defined treatments (1). PIM represented weed and seed bank population dynamics, weed-crop competition, weed treatment impacts, agronomic practices and financial details. The bio-economic model could be used to evaluate weed management scenarios by investigating the implications of different tillage, fallow and cereal rotational sequences and of constraints on herbicide availability. Model validation combined available data from literature with our own data, to show that PIM was sufficiently accurate for predicting P. rhoeas population dynamics. Sensitivity analyses indicated that economics associated with fuel, fertiliser and seed costs, as well as grain yield and price, were primary drivers of management decisions, whereas seedling emergence and initial seed bank size were of secondary importance.

Weed community dynamics in two pastures grown after clearing Brazilian Amazonian rainforest	WEED RESEARCH												P>To explain the dynamics of the weed vegetation in the Amazonian pastures after clearing of the rainforest, the diversity and floristic composition of 15 Brachiaria brizantha pastures and seven Panicum maximum pastures of various ages were studied. These pastures reflect the original forest, from which they retain a high species richness (from 20 to 73 species on average per 50 m2), a high proportion of forest woody species (from 26% to 65%) and rare species (> 50%). The four ecological groups of plants, namely forest woody species, pioneer/secondary woody species, forest herbaceous species and secondary herbaceous species, are present in all pastures immediately after the clearing and burning of the forest and have to compete with the two sown forage species, B. brizantha and P. maximum. Because of its erect habit, P. maximum is rapidly invaded by secondary herbaceous weeds, whereas B. brizantha with its spreading habit slows down their proliferation, which therefore takes about 10 years to complete. The study showed the importance of factors such as the initial vegetation, manual-clearing practices, duration of cropping and species grown in influencing the floristic composition of the pastures and on the diversity of weeds. These results show the response of weeds faced with human disturbance. The results also demonstrate that farmers can manage pastures in a spirit of conservation of diversity or for weed control.

We characterized germination response to temperature in seeds from populations occurring at six sites along a 700-km north south transect (Kentucky to Michigan). Seeds were collected in 2000 and 2002 from randomly selected plants (350 to 400), at each sampling site. Two germination patterns were observed: (1) seeds from the southern locations averaged 80 to 90% germination across the range of 5 to 25 C; and (2) seeds from northern locations had reduced germination when incubation temperatures were close to 5 or 25 C. When seed from all locations were grown in a common environment (14/10-h thermoperiod of 22/18 C), their progeny had a germination response that was similar across the temperature gradient, regardless of original location, suggesting germination of the parent seed was due to maternal environmental effects. In a subsequent experiment, common groundsel was grown in growth chambers with warm long days (22/15 C and 16 h of light), warm short days (8 h of light), cold long days (15/8 C and 16 h of light), and cold short days. Eighty percent of seeds from the warm environments germinated across the range from 5 to 25 C indicating that these maternal conditions had produced nondormant seeds. In contrast, 20% or fewer of the seeds from plants in the cold chambers germinated regardless of temperature, suggesting that dormancy had been induced by the cool maternal environment. Results also indicated that signaling of maternal environment varied with inflorescence development stages, meaning the earlier the inflorescences are exposed to cold conditions, the lower the percent germination in F(1) seeds. Preventing seed maturation on common groundsel growing under cool conditions may reduce the formation of a persistent seed bank.																	0043-1745					APR-JUN	2010	58	2					160	166		10.1614/WS-D-09-00006.1							WOS:000277059500012						
J	Toth, LA				Toth, Louis A.			Restoration Response of Relict Broadleaf Marshes to Increased Water Depths	WETLANDS												Broadleaf marsh once covered much of the wetland landscape along the Kissimmee River in central Florida, USA, but is currently restricted to remnant portions of the channelized floodplain that have been subjected to much shallower depths. The initial phase of Kissimmee River restoration, which began in 1999, and a prior (1984-1990) demonstration project increased water depths in several relict broadleaf marshes on the floodplain. Effects of restored water depth regimes on characteristics of these altered broadleaf marsh communities were evaluated. As expected, plant species richness consistently declined in marshes with increased water depth, but cover of signature broadleaf species, Sagittaria lancifolia and Pontederia cordata, exhibited variable responses to restored hydrology. In one marsh mean cover of Sagittaria and Pontederia increased from 32 to 62% following a 37 cm increase in mean annual depths; however, in another relict marsh that underwent a similar increase in hydroperiods and depths, mean cover of these species remained below 30% and Panicum hemitomon persisted as a dominant species. Moreover, invasion of the exotic wetland shrub, Ludwigia peruviana, appears to pose a threat to successful restoration of broadleaf marshes on the Kissimmee floodplain.																	0277-5212					APR	2010	30	2					263	274		10.1007/s13157-010-0028-8							WOS:000278625800009
